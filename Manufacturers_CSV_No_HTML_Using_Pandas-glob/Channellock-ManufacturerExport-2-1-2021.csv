","Not all cutting edges are the same -- only CHANNELLOCK® uses precision machined knife and anvil style cutting edges to ensure perfect mating and superior cutting edge life. The CHANNELLOCK® knife and anvil cutters ensure proper cutting edge alignment, resulting in a clean cut every time. Most manufacturers use two sharp edges which can become misaligned, losing their cutting effectiveness. Experience the difference for yourself.

","Not all cutting edges are the same -- only CHANNELLOCK® uses precision machined knife and anvil style cutting edges to ensure perfect mating and superior cutting edge life. The CHANNELLOCK® knife and anvil cutters ensure proper cutting edge alignment, resulting in a clean cut every time. Most manufacturers use two sharp edges which can become misaligned, losing their cutting effectiveness. Experience the difference for yourself.
