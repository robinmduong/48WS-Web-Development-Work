Forget the showers of hot metal chips and sparks that were once an aerial threat on metal construction jobsites. The 6370 shears the metal, producing a virtually spark-free wake and cool, burr and scorch-free edges that don't require post-cut finishing. Cool cut waste, in the form of metal shavings, is effectively contained with a durable magnesium blade shield and channeled into the saw's integral ChipTank. Cool cutting also means that materials can be handled almost immediately following a cut, reducing downtime.   Driven by a powerful 13 amp (1-3/4 max HP), 3,700 RPM motor and equipped with a full grill of razor-sharp, cermet-tip teeth, the 6370 tears through tough cuts without hesitation. Count on up to 10 gauge sheets and 1/4 in. steel plate cuts, all day, every day. More extreme cuts, even up to 3/4 in. steel plate, are possible when proper operating techniques are used.   Any way you slice it, cold cutting metal means value. Internal test results indicate that our new metal cutting blades last a minimum of 25 times a standard abrasive wheel. Specially-formulated cermet tip metallurgy and tooth geometry ensure these incredible blades cut faster, stay sharp longer, and resist more impacts. Translation? A significantly lower cost per cut ($0.20 versus $0.60), not to mention the savings associated with 1 versus 25 blade changes.   To keep on target, the new 6370 features a set of on-board sight-line and blade point-of-entry indicators along with a slot in the saw's shoe for a rip fence. It is also the first and only corded metal cutting saw to feature a lower guard retraction lever. Plunge cuts, a frequent challenge for metal roofing contractors, are fast and furious with this exciting new tool. The lever's location, adjacent to the side handle, ensures that the user has both hands firmly on the saw throughout the cut.   Beyond its capacity to cut solid, thicker gauge materials, the 6370, with a 2-9/16 in. cut-depth, screams through most corrugated metal roofing and decking sheets, structural, shape, grating and framing materials in one-pass. Insufficient cut depth means material must be flipped over and re-cut, usually a two-man operation.   To ensure a smooth ride, the new 6370 is equipped with a set of serious comfort features. The tool's rear and side handles feature soft, tactile gripping surfaces and are designed to comfortably fit any user's hands. The side handle is canted forward to reduce wrist strain as well as wrapped completely to the motor housing, offering maximum comfort and control in any cutting orientation.    Down-time is lost time so we've added valuable, time-saving features to the 6370.

Featuring a 1-3/4 max HP (11 Amp, 24,000 RPM) Milwaukee motor, these powerful and precise new routers give you the upper hand in all but the heaviest of cuts. The BodyGrip&reg; design is a comfortable over-molded rubber grip wrapped around the base with an adjustable handstrap that allows for left and right-handed operation, and two over-molded palm-grip side handles for superior comfort, maneuverability and control.    The exclusive linear depth adjustment features a large steel motor lock lever and depth adjustment gearing via a durable threaded screw integral to the motor itself. Both coarse and microfine adjustments are fast and accurate. The router sub-base includes a special access hole for a common 3/8 in. hex extension wrench for above-the-table depth adjustments, ideal for router table applications and eliminating the nuisance of reaching beneath table to set the cutter (or bit) height. This revolutionary system simplifies this once tedious process required with other designs and ensures that the switch and cord remain in the same optimal location.    The kit version (5615-21) features an impact resistant carrying case with heavy-duty metal hinges, comfortable free-swinging handle, and on-board wrench and collet storage. Also included is an integral RouterStation™, a removable base that fastens quickly and securely to any work surface, providing convenient and reliable storage for the router and accessories. This patented design eliminates the need to change the depth setting or remove the bit altogether before storing the router.    For the router user who prefers a trigger control we've created a D-handle version (5619-20). This unit features a durable glass-filled nylon handle with comfortable cushion-grip and a trigger switch with special lock-on button for continuous effortless operation.

The revolutionary system can be accessed from above a router table with the included T-wrench or any 3/8 in. hex socket wrench with extension, eliminating the need for awkward, below the table adjustments or the need for an auxiliary router lift.    With an industry standard bolt-hole pattern and router base diameter along with removable handles for insert plate clearance, the 5625-20 readily converts any existing table or production jig set-up. For added protection when table-mounted, the router features an exclusive motor contamination shield that keeps damaging debris out without sacrificing airflow. The router also features a durable, rubber shield for dust-free access to the height adjustment system.   For maximum operator control and comfort, the 5625-20 router has impact-resistant, tactile-grip handles set wide apart and angled forward.

REDLINK PLUS™ intelligence prevents damage to the tool and battery due to overloading or overheating.  REDLITHIUM™ batteries deliver more work per charge and more work over the life of the battery. Compatible with ONE-KEY™, this is the industry’s first High Torque Impact Wrench that wirelessly connects to a smart phone to Customize, Track and Manage a tool’s performance and location. Unlimited Tool Customization allows you to connect to the tool and access predetermined set-ups for specific fasteners and materials, or have complete control over output speed and power for the specific application at hand. With ONE-KEY™, users now have a tool that delivers the most repeatable torque output in the industry.  Users looking for a targeted torque range now have solution that will get users close to their targeted torque value, reducing the likelihood of significant under or over torque.  Users will experience less rework, less damage, and increased productivity that will get users closer to their torque target and will finish with a calibrated torque device to reach their targeted torque value. The tool’s memory supports up to 4 custom profiles that can be easily accessed with the touch of a button on the tool. Once the profiles are saved to the tool, the connection to the smart phone is no longer necessary. Your custom profiles are also saved in the cloud so that they can be accessed at any time. Integrated Tool Tracking, also available through ONE-KEY™, provides full visibility to how and where tools are being used across your network of jobs and users. The app will track all ONE-KEY™ compatible devices within 100 ft range of your phone. By building the functionality into the tool, not the battery, all devices are trackable even if the battery is not charged or on the tool. The app will automatically keep records of the last time a tool was within range of the app, allowing you to pinpoint missing tools quicker and increase accountability of your crew.
