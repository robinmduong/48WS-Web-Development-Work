Description: Multi material rotary drill
bit with a unique carbide tip consisting of specially designed for purpose
geometry and centering tips
1. Unique carbide geometry & centering  
tips - fast start up and drilling
2. Modern heat-teatment and brazing 
processes ensuring proper combination of product hardness, toughness and durability resulting in maximum life
3.  BC20 grade of carbide, diamond ground - designed specifically for relevant materials
4. Perfect balance between tip (4a) and 
flute (4b) geometry allows fast and immediate debris removal. Allowing 
smoother, faster drilling 
No center punch needed - eliminates ""walking""
Ideal for cordless drills, corded drills & drill presses","Shank Diameter:1/4""Overall Length: 4""

Matching combination left hand industrial steel screw extractor and high speed steel twist drill
Made in the USA
Screw extractor spiral flute design
Brute Platinum twist drill avoids needing pilot hole, 135 degree split point
Use left hand twist drills in left hand rotation machinery
","Champion Cutting Tool ipac system provides you with professional grade cutting tool combinations of industrial steel screw extractor and Brute Platinum left hand high speed steel twist drill designed for electrical, plumbing, mechanical contracting, welding, machine shop and home maintenance. Brute Platinum XL5LH jobber length twist drills outperform standard ""drill bits"". You will get faster hole penetration and more holes per drill. Each twist drill is provided with a unique combination of premium high speed steel, geometries and NOMO (Nitride on Margin Only) surface treatment. This combination of treatment inables Brute Platinum twist drills to penetrate multiple 300 and 400 series stainless steel, austenitic stainless steel, mild and hardened titanium steel alloys, carbon steel and softer steel materials like copper alloys. Nitriding is the best substitute for cobalt drills and still has flexibility to avoid shattering. With the precision ground 135 degree split point tip there is no need to predrill pilot holes. Brute Platinum left hand twist drills will bit right into the material avoiding the walking effect in common 118 degree twist drills. Designed for use in left hand rotation multiple spindle, gear driven drilling heads, scew machine operations, lathes and any machinery with a left hand rotation. Left hand twist drills are also commonly used for drilling out broken or frozen bolts. The tapered web geometry in each twist drill provides faster penetration of the material. Our matching X1 industrial steel left hand, spiral flute, screw extractors are designed to remove broken screws, studs, bolts, or pipe fittings.

Matching combination left hand industrial steel screw extractor and high speed steel twist drill
Made in the USA
Screw extractor spiral flute design
Brute Platinum twist drill avoids needing pilot hole, 135 degree split point
Use left hand twist drills in left hand rotation machinery
","Champion Cutting Tool ipac system provides you with professional grade cutting tool combinations of industrial steel screw extractor and Brute Platinum left hand high speed steel twist drill designed for electrical, plumbing, mechanical contracting, welding, machine shop and home maintenance. Brute Platinum XL5LH jobber length twist drills outperform standard ""drill bits"". You will get faster hole penetration and more holes per drill. Each twist drill is provided with a unique combination of premium high speed steel, geometries and NOMO (Nitride on Margin Only) surface treatment.
