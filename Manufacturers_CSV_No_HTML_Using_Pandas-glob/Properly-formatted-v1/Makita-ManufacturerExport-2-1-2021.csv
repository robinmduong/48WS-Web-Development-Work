Makita’s hard-hitting HR3210C 1-1/4” Rotary Hammer (accepts SDS-PLUS bits) combines power with less weight, and is equipped with Anti-Vibration Technology (AVT®), an internal counterbalance system that reduces vibration. The result is more efficient hitting on the concrete and less vibration in the tool – and for the tool user.   8.2 AMP Power with 3-Mode Operation The HR3210C with AVT® is engineered with an 8.2 AMP motor that provides plenty of power, with a no load speed of 315 to 630 RPM and 1,650 to 3,300 BPM. The synchronized RPM and BPM prevent overlapping impacts for up to 50% more efficient drilling. The hammer features 3-mode operation: “rotation only,” “hammering with rotation” and “hammering only,” with a built-in torque limiter that ensures stable torque control and disengages the motor should the bit bind or hit reinforcements. In addition, the electronic speed control reduces speed loss when working in heavy applications to ensure maximum productivity.   The HR3210C also has a variable speed dial with 5 settings to match the bit speed to the application. An L.E.D. power light indicates switch failure or cord breakage, and an L.E.D. service light indicates when carbon brushes need to be replaced. The HR3210C is built with large size carbon brushes that have up to twice the life of competitor models.   More Work, Less Vibration The HR3210C is equipped with AVT, Makita’s exclusive counterbalance system that reduces vibration for more efficient hitting power. The HR3210C weighs 11.4 lbs. and has a straight side handle with rubberized grips and a large rubberized rear handle, all of which contribute to the overall comfort of the tool. The recessed operation mode switch helps prevent it from being damaged, while the one-touch sliding chuck allows for quick bit changes.   Versatile Design for a Range of Applications The HR3210C is a versatile, hard-hitting rotary hammer for masons, remodelers, electricians, plumbers, demolition contractors, and general contractors seeking a best-in-class industrial quality rotary hammer. The tool can take on a range of tasks – from breaking up a tile floor to breaking up concrete.",,,,,"1-1/4"" AVT® Rotary Hammer, accepts SDS-PLUS bits"

Large Cutting Capacity, Increased Accuracy The LS1216L will crosscut wide boards up to 15” wide at 90°, right out of the box with no special set up required. It has an innovative direct drive gearbox and patented retractable guard system engineered for increased vertical cutting capacity and the largest crown molding cutting capacity (8” vertically nested) in its class. The patented retractable rear guard also provides the LS1216L with 6-1/2” baseboard cutting capacity (vertical). In addition, the exclusive 6 linear ball bearings deliver smooth, solid and adjustment-free “dead-on” accurate cuts. The saw also has a patented 4-Steel Rail Sliding System that further increases rigidity to produce superior cuts, as the four steel rails provide less deflection. The result is a larger cutting capacity and more accuracy.   Precise Miter and Bevel Cuts The LS1216L has an exclusive 5-1/2” tall sliding fence system, with four sliding fences featuring upper and lower fence adjustments for more precise miter and bevel cuts to accommodate a variety of cutting applications. The saw miters 0° to 52° left and 0 to 60° right, with positive stops at 0°, 15°, 22.5°, 31.6°, and 45° (left and right). The dual rear-handle bevel lock is easily accessible with adjustments 0° to 45° (left and right), with positive stops at 0°, 22.5°, 33.9°, and 45° (left and right).   Precision adjustments are made easier with dual front bevel scales for improved visibility. The easy one-touch (push in & turn) miter lock system is designed for accurate adjustments and increased efficiency. For more precise cuts, a built-in laser indicates the line of cut whether the blade is turning or not, and also includes an on-off switch and micro-adjustments for precise “left-of-blade” or “right-of-blade” cutting.   Ease-of-Use Features In addition to the large cutting capacity, power, and accuracy, the LS1216L offers a range of convenience and ease-of-use features. The LS1216L has a patented 4-Steel Rail Sliding System that requires less rear space than competitor dual sliding miter saws. The see-through blade guard system provides greater visibility of blade and line of cut, and has a one-step blade change process for increased efficiency. The ergonomic rubberized horizontal D-handle design has a better fit and added comfort, and the large trigger switch is designed for easier operation.  15 AMP Power for Smoother, Higher-Quality Cutting The LS1216L has a 15 AMP direct gear box motor that never slips, bogs down, or requires maintenance like belt-driven saws. The soft start feature delivers smoother start-ups, and the Electronic Speed Control maintains constant speed under load for smoother, higher-quality cutting.   Best in Class for a Range of Applications The LS1216L is engineered for precision tasks in woodworking shops as well as for cutting large materials like 4x16 beams and wide boards up to 15”. It is ideal for a broad range of trades, including finish carpenters, professional woodworkers, case and base installers, cabinet installers, cabinet manufacturers, closet installers, decking and flooring applications, siding installers, stair installers, and general contractors seeking a best-in-class 12” dual slide compound miter saw for the jobsite, benchtop, or high-production/manufacturing setting.",,,,,"12"" Dual Slide Compound Miter Saw with Laser"

A key point of difference is the industrial 2-sided magnesium (not aluminum) crank case for less weight and added durability. For faster and easier starts, the spring-assisted starter with optimized engine management reduces force required for starting. The result is a versatile and durable chain saw with a superior power-to-weight ratio that delivers consistent performance, job after job.    Unlike common spring-aided starters that make slight improvements in pull-force, Makita’s easy-start feature combines spring-aided engineering with a new low spark ignition coil that includes Memory-Power-Ignition (MPI) technology.

The XRH01ZVX is the industry's first 1"" capacity rotary hammer in the 18V category, and sets new standards in the cordless tool category.   It’s part of Makita’s expanding 18V Lithium-Ion system, the world’s largest cordless tool system powered by 18V Lithium-Ion slide-style batteries. Makita 18V Lithium-Ion batteries have the fastest charge times in their categories, so they spend more time working and less time sitting on the charger.  For improved tool performance and extended battery life, Makita created Star Protection Computer Controls™. Star Protection is communication technology that allows the Star Protection-equipped tool and battery to exchange data in real time and monitor conditions during use to protect against overloading, over-discharging and overheating. For increased versatility, the tool can also be powered by Makita 18V LXT® and Compact Lithium-Ion batteries with the star symbol on the battery indicating Star Protection inside.  The XRH01ZVX is powered by an efficient BL™ Brushless Motor with variable speed that delivers 0-950 RPM, 4,700 BPM, and 2.0 Joules with up to 50% longer run time than current Makita 18V LXT® rotary hammers. The efficiency of the BL™ Brushless Motor allowed Makita engineers to power both the tool and the separate vacuum motor with a single 18V (not 36V) Lithium-Ion battery (sold separately). The separate vacuum motor also increases suction efficiency without sacrificing the performance of the rotary hammer. The result is a powerful and efficient rotary hammer with vacuum attachment that delivers the same drilling capacity as the leading competitors’ 36V rotary hammers, but with up to 2.5 lbs. less weight (with battery, sold separately).   The HEPA Dust Extraction Vacuum Attachment is trigger-activated for user convenience. The rubber suction gasket is engineered to provide consistent contact with the work surface, where the dust is channeled to the clear dust container with HEPA filter, which captures 99.95% of dust particles (size .3 microns). An added feature is a 2-second delay on the vacuum motor: After the trigger is released, the 2-second extended suction collects remnant dust and particles as the bit is being pulled out of the work surface, making the XRH01ZVX ideal for overhead drilling.   The high capacity dust container is clear and provides an accurate level indicator of collected material. The container also has the largest material holding capacity in its class with faster and more convenient disposal of material than leading competitor models for less downtime. The vacuum attachment has a quick release and can be easily detached from the rotary hammer when not needed. Additional ease-of-use and efficiency features include 3-mode operation (rotation only, hammering with rotation and hammer only), a large 2-finger trigger for more convenience and greater comfort, and a depth adjustment guide for increased drilling depth accuracy.",,,,,"18V LXT® Lithium-Ion Brushless Cordless 1"" Rotary Hammer, accepts SDS-PLUS bits, w/ HEPA Dust Extractor Attachment, Tool Only"

Angle Grinder combines a Makita-built 10 AMP motor with best-in-class durability features to deliver more output power and increased performance. The 9564P is ideal for welders, fabricators, ship yard contractors, masons, electricians, automotive technicians, stone and tile contractors, HVAC, and more.  The 9564P is equipped with SJS™ mechanical clutch syster, a Makita innovation engineered to protect the motor and gears. With SJS™, the drive shaft from the armature to the drive gear is spring-loaded during normal grinding load. If binding occurs or the wheel is forced to stop, the spring is compressed, which allows the drive shaft to slip. The result: gear tension is minimized for longer gear life as the armature continues to rotate, which helps prevent motor burn-out.  The motor-protection function of SJS™ is mechanical, not electronic. This is a key point-of-difference, as the mechanical function does not require the contractor to stop and re-start the tool in the event that the wheel is forced to stop. With an electronic clutch, the tool requires a re-start.  The 9564P is distinguished from other grinders in its class by three innovative dust and debris defense features. First is Labyrinth Construction, a series of channels engineered to capture dust and debris. This prevents contaminants from penetrating the gear box and main bearing. A second feature is Makita’s unique “zig zag” application pattern, which is a more innovative option than simply covering the coils with epoxy. The zig-zag pattern allows space for heat to escape, yet at the same time the zig-zag pattern forms a solid barrier under rotation to prevent debris from attaching. Finally, the Dust Sealed Drive Bearing is a spring-loaded metal seal is engineered to stop dust and debris from entering the drive bearing.  Additional performance features include a larger cooling fan and blades, which pull more air through the motor to help maintain lower operating temperatures, as well as spiral bevel gears for smoother rotations and a more efficient transfer of power.",,,,,"4-1/2"" SJS™ Paddle Switch Angle Grinder"

The demolition hammer features Anti-Vibration Technology (AVT®) and vibration-absorbing rear handle to further reduce vibration. Constant speed control that automatically applies additional power to the motor to maintain speed under load to complete challenging jobs and a variable speed control dial enables users to match speed to the application.  The HM1213C has a ""soft no-load"" function, which automatically reduces the speed of the motor when not in use which helps increase tool life and performance. The Makita Motor is engineered with field core interlocking steel laminations, dual ball bearing armature and more copper commutator bars, increasing energy transfer efficiency for more power and longer tool life Other features include an L.E.D. power light to indicate switch failure or cord damage and an L.E.D service light that notifies the user that the brushes need to be replaced. An automatic brush cut-off protects the commutator from damage for longer tool life. The 12 bit angle settings allows the bit to be set a different positions for operator comfort.  Anti-Vibration Technology (AVT®) is a counterbalance system inside the tool that significantly reduces vibration. The AVT counterbalance design is based on seismic engineering, which developed this damping science to absorb shocks and protect buildings from earthquakes. AVT uses a mechanical damper, effectively a counterbalance weight inside the tool, that provides an equal and opposite force that puts a mass directly opposite the point where the striker bolt delivers the impact. As vibration is eliminated, power is efficiently increased which allows more of the generated energy in the motor to be delivered to the tool bit. For users, AVT means significantly less vibration with no compromise in power and performance.",,,088381-605342,,"12 lb. AVT® Demolition Hammer, accepts SDS-MAX bits"
