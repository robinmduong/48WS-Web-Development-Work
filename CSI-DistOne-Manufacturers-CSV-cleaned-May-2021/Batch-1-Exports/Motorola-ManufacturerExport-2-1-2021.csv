Charge your new battery overnight before using it.
When using a rapid charger, leave the battery in the charger for an additional 1 to 2 hours after the green light appears.
Only charge a battery when it needs it. If it is not fully discharged, do not recharge it. We suggest that you carry a spare.
Do not return fully charged batteries to the charger for an ""extra boost."" This action will significantly reduce cycle life. Repeated short cycle charging of batteries will shorten battery life.
