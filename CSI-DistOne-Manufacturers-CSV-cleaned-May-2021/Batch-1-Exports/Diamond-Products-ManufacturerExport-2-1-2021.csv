Built on a standard PC6000 platform with full electronic control and instrumentation as well as advanced features such as data logging and electronic blade measurement
A full industrial computer acts as an operator interface for the machine allowing the operator t monitor conditions and adjust set points as needed
Sensors located around the machine constantly monitor operation conditions and adjust forward travel speed
Computer that delivers total control of depth control wheels, engine load and forward speed.","Dimensions: Length: 47' Width: 8'6"" Height: 11'.
Weight: 53,000 lbs. with grinding head and fuel tank full. 75,000 lbs with water tank full.

Transportation: Machine is a legal load (with water tank empty) for standard 3-axle tractor.  Axle loads are approximately 25,000 lbs. on trailer tandem and 25,000 lbs. on tractor tandem. no permits required. Standard light and air connections.

Power: 680 HP QSX15-630 Cummins diesel engine, liquid cooled.

Cutting Width: 50"" maximum. Blade Diameter: 14"", 16"" or 18"".

Fuel capacity: 450 gallons (tank supplies both main and auxiliary engine).

Fuel Consumption: 22-25 gph (main engine).

Hydraulic System: 50 gallon hydraulic reservoir.

Head Drive: Power from the engine transmitted through a manually operated/over center PTO clutch into a right  angle drive gearbox through a special shock absorbing coupler.The output shafts of the right angle gearbox drive two timed synchronous belts which transmit the power to the blade shaft.

Function Power: Provided by an axial piston pump which delivers 24 GPM to Rexroth control valves.

Instrumentation: Blade Coolant Pressure Gauge and Alarm; Right Angle Drive Pressure Gauge. Engine Instrumentation and Industrial PC.

Other Features: Dual Controls with electronic joysticks on each side to control ground drive.  Electro-Hydraulically operated depth control jacks reduce operator fatigue.  Integral two-speed wheel motors increase travel speed while automatically selecting the appropriate travel gear.

Blades: 14"", 16"" or 18"" blades may be used with the PC6000EC.",,Diamond Products PC6000EC Highway Grinder,Highway Grinder,,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
