Cost effective solution for indoor, light-duty applications
Pressure sensitive rubber adhesive provides quick stick to a variety of surfaces
Provides conformability on irregular surfaces and around corners

Ideal for marking, temporary holding, wrapping and sealing

3M™ Paper Masking Tape 2214 is a cost-effective, crepe paper backed tape that holds, bundles, seals and performs other non-critical taping jobs where a pressure sensitive tape is needed. This tape offers controlled unwind and tears easily from the roll by hand.
","Everyday Excellence

Tape, we take it for granted, but it is simply indispensable. Take our 3M™ Paper Masking Tape 2214, for example. It is a basic crepe-paper baked masking tape ideally suited for general, light-duty indoor use and non-critical paint masking. It remains in place around corners and over contoured surfaces. Our rubber adhesive sticks instantly to paper, metal, wood plastic, glass, painted and other clean surfaces while resisting lifting or curling. It can withstand use in temperatures up to 200°F/93°C for up to 30 minutes work time, and it detaches from the roll smoothly for easy control. 
Recommended Applications




General indoor light-duty use

Light duty holding or bundling applications

Non-critical paint masking

Light duty sealing

Labeling


Why Masking Tape?

Masking tape was developed specifically to help protect surrounding surfaces from overspray, provide clean paint lines, and remove easily and cleanly when finished. Our masking tapes adhere well, resist solvents or water from the paint and are strong enough to hang plastic sheeting, yet remove cleanly without damaging the subsurface .The backing, typically crepe paper, hand tears easily and sticks when applied to curved and irregular surfaces without lifting or curling. Various masking tapes are designed for different applications and should be removed within their specified time range. A very thin or poorly manufactured tape may splinter or shred when coming off the roll or being removed after use. A roll of masking tape is a basic toolbox or supply room item in any construction, warehousing, military, marine, shipping, or retail industry.
