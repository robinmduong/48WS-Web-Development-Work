Other  thickness(s) 2"" through 5"" are available by special order. NOTE: Lesser product thickness may be used providing  the installed thickness of insulation measured between the  cold side of wall and the fire side of the wall is a minimum  4”(102mm) when a 3 hour rating is desired.   Heavier densities of DELTA ®  BOARD will provide equal  or better fire stopping performance when installed along  with the safing specifications.","DELTA® SAFING BOARD is a minimum 4 pound per  cubic foot (64 kg./m3) density insulation manufactured  from high temperature mineral fiber bonded together  with a fire retardant binder. Its primary use is for fire  containment located between the concrete floor slab  edge and exterior walls in high-rise building  construction.  DELTA® SAFING Mineral Wool BOARD  can be used as a “poke-through” fire barrier for part of a  hourly-rated assembly in cracks, crevices, openings,  and around penetrations.",,Rock Wool Manufacturing Co Safing Mineral Wool,Safing Mineral Wool
