Buffalo Industries now offers a disposable coverall program that can assist your company with compliance of OSHA CFR 1926.62.Coveralls, or similar full-body work clothing, are needed to keep the lead paint particulates from resting on underlying clothing and being transported accidentally out of the work area. Buffalo’s Lead Abatement Coveralls are one component needed in order to be compliant with the RRP and should be used in conjunction with other protective devices such as gloves, respirators etc. Our Lead Abatement Coveralls are made from breathable 3-layer material and include an elastic hood, wrists, and attached booties.
