No scoring saw needed.,"TENRYU'S professionals' choice for high performance panel saw cutting. The same, superior features and benefits of our Mel-Pro series in sizes to fit the most popular panel saws. Excellent for long lasting, precise cuts in wood, wood composites, and laminated materials on panel saws. Panel saws are often used to cut large sheets of ""difficult"" materials like MDF, melamine or particle board. These materials are laden with chemicals and adhesives which attack the carbide causing corrosion of the cutting edge. The Panel-Pro blades come equipped with our best anti-corrosive micro-grain carbide. That, plus our super-flat, perfectly tensioned plate adds up to very precise, long lasting performance on your panel saw! For cutting aluminum materials on panel saws, see our Alumi-Cut Series blades. For cutting Solid Surface Materials, see our Pro Series for Solid Surface. Try these blades even without the scoring saw- you'll love the results! EACH BLADE FEATURES: Fully-hardened, expertly-tensioned tool steel bodies for true and accurate cuts. High-grade, extra hard, wear-resistant carbide tips for long life. Fine grit honing of carbide edges for clean, smooth cuts.

Specially formulated C-6 carbide grade, combined with our unique tip design, resists breakage on impact and lasts longer- much longer than standard carbides or abrasive discs. Special tooth geometry with ""inserted"" tooth design greatly improves security of the tip, efficiency and durability. Abrasive discs throw sparks and lots of dust including unhealthful fiberglass. You shouldn't be breathing it in! Steel-Pro® blades reduce spark production and eliminate abrasive wheel dust. Abrasive discs wear quickly, requiring frequent blade changes. Steel-Pro® blades allow you to keep working; eliminating down time for frequent blade changes. In addition, Steel-Pro® cuts 5 to 10 times faster than abrasives. Typically, one Steel-Pro® blade will outlast somewhere between 15 to 30 abrasive blades. Think of all that non-productive ""down time"". Abrasive discs leave a sharp burr at the cutting edge that must be removed later. Steel-Pro® blades cut clean; eliminating this extremely time-consuming after-cut process. ""Time is money"". Steel-Pro® saves BOTH!","TENRYU's complete series of steel cutting saw blades called ""Steel-Pro®"" makes light work out of all kinds of mild steel: steel studs, steel sheet, steel pipe, channel, threaded rod and much, much more.
