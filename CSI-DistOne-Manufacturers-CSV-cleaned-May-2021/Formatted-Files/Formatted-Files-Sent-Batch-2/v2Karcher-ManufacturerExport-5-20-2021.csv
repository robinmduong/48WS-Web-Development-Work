It is equipped with two contra-rotating roller brushes and a handle that rotates up to 90 degrees on both sides and can be locked in position. In the normal position, the machine is swung to the right and left like a single-disc machine and achieves a high area performance. Locking the handle in the 90-degree position allows the operator to work in precise lanes, moving forward and backward as with a standard scrubber dryer for effective cleaning of large areas and precision cleaning close to walls and other fixed obstacles. Even heavily structured surfaces, such as studded rubber floors and non-slip tiles, present no problems. Its low-profile construction enables it to reach floor areas underneath radiators, cupboards and shelves. The smooth-running induction motor has a high power output of 1600 W. The motor bracket is made of solid aluminium and the base plate of stainless steel for durability. No tools are required for carbon brush replacement. Two sturdy rollers guarantee easy maneuverablity, and the fold-down handle enables the unit to be stored and transported easily.","This innovative single-disc-style machine with counter-rotating roller brushes is suitable for deep cleaning and maintenance cleaning on hard surfaces as well as stripping, shampooing and polishing.",Technical data                                                                                                                           Working width                                                                                                                                                                                   16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Brush speed                                     (rpm)                                                                                                                                              650                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Sound pressure level                                     (dB(A))                                                                                                                                              73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Length of cord access.

The Puzzi 30/4 is easy to carry, even when lying flat with a full fresh water tank, and its large castor wheels make it easy to transport over stairs.","The Puzzi 30/4 spray extraction cleaner is the economical cleaning solution for large carpet surfaces and makes cleaning ergonomic, stress-free and quick.",Technical data                                                                                                                           Area performance                                     (/)                                                                                                                                              Min. / Max. / 75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Air flow                                                                                                                                                                                   157                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Waterlift                                                                                                                                                                                   85                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Spray pressure/ram pressure                                     (bar)                                                                                                                                              4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Spray rate                                     (l/s)                                                                                                                                              3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Power                                     (A)                                                                                                                                              10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Fresh / waste water tank                                     (gal)                                                                                                                                              8 / 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Ship Weight (with accessories)                                     (lbs)                                                                                                                                              61.6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dimensions (L x W x H)                                                                                                                                                                                   22.8 x 18.1 x 36.6,,,Extractors Puzzi 30/4

As a result, only the required amount of energy and cleaning agent is used.",The B 40 C/W walk-behind scrubber has a host of technical refinements and innovations for the primary purpose of making work as simple and convenient as possible.,Technical data                                                                                                                           Brush working width                                                                                                                                                                                   17 / 20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Vacuum working width                                                                                                                                                                                   33.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Fresh / waste water tank                                     (gal)                                                                                                                                              10.6 / 10.6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Max. area performance                                                                                                                                                                                   18300                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Brush speed                                     (rpm)                                                                                                                                              180                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rated input power                                     (W)                                                                                                                                              max. 1300                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Traction motor                                     (W)                                                                                                                                              130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Weight without battery                                     (lbs)                                                                                                                                              220                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dimensions (L x W x H)                                                                                                                                                                                   54 x 22.6 x 45,,,Scrubber drier B 40 C/W (disc)

For very sticky dirt, the squeegees can be lifted with a foot pedal. Chemicals have more time to react, for better overall cleaning. Hard to reach areas (e.g., under furniture) are no problem thanks to the very low brush head.","Whether in a restaurant, store, hotel or kitchen, the BR 30/4 C scrubs and dries all hard surfaces gently and effectively.

With the powerful battery (36 V / 344 Ah), long work intervals are possible. Thanks to the short wheelbase and the low device width, the machine impresses with its maneuverability and optimized area coverage. Even confined spaces can be cleaned thoroughly. Thanks to FACT, the brush speed can be adjusted to one of 3 levels according to requirements - Power Clean, Whisper and Fine Clean. The user-friendly EASY Operation switch and the intuitive color-coding enable extremely easy operation. With the eco!efficiency mode, turbine power, water volume and roller speed are reduced.

With the powerful battery (36 V / 344 Ah), long work intervals are possible. Thanks to the short wheelbase and the low device width, the machine impresses with its maneuverability and optimized area coverage. Even confined spaces can be cleaned thoroughly. Thanks to FACT, the brush speed can be adjusted to one of 3 levels according to requirements - Power Clean, Whisper and Fine Clean.

With the powerful battery (36 V / 344 Ah), long work intervals are possible. Thanks to the short wheelbase and the low device width, the machine impresses with its maneuverability and optimized area coverage. Even confined spaces can be cleaned thoroughly. Thanks to FACT, the brush speed can be adjusted to one of 3 levels according to requirements - Power Clean, Whisper and Fine Clean.

With the powerful battery (36 V / 344 Ah), long work intervals are possible. Thanks to the short wheelbase and the low device width, the machine impresses with its maneuverability and optimized area coverage. Even confined spaces can be cleaned thoroughly. Thanks to FACT, the brush speed can be adjusted to one of 3 levels according to requirements - Power Clean, Whisper and Fine Clean. The user-friendly EASY Operation switch and the intuitive color-coding enable extremely easy operation. With the eco!efficiency mode, turbine power, water volume and roller speed are reduced. Water and energy are saved and the run time is increased by around 20%. (This is a configuration example.

At 90 mm tall, the unit is flat enough to reach beneath radiators and furniture with low ground clearance. It picks up loose dirt within just 2 mm of its edges. The telescopic broomstick has a push handle and can be adjusted to suit the operator’s height, while a universal joint enables it to move in all directions. When not in use, it locks into the vertical position. The electric broom can run for roughly 30 minutes on carpets and 45 minutes on hard floors before the powerful nickel cadmium battery requires recharging. Charging time can be reduced from 12 hours to 50 minutes using the optional fast charger. Batteries can be swapped to permit uninterrupted working. No tools are required to change batteries or remove the roller brush. Any fibers that get wound around the brush can be removed by running a knife along a specially designed groove to sever them.","This is the first battery-powered electric broom for commercial users.

Patented rotating side brush allows cleaning in corners in a single pass. Cleans in a single pass, unlike other machines which need 5 to 7 passes. The position of the main roller brush between the rear wheels allows driving over high curbs without damage to the sweeping system. The Teach system automatically adjusts the main roller brush appropriate to wear for constant, optimal sweeping results. There are three contact pressures to choose from, depending on the surface and type of dirt.

This benefit pays for itself through longer operating periods between filter bag changes. Motor performance, air flow and the 6-stage filter system (with optional microfilter) have been designed to prevent loss of suction power. Its low center of gravity provides stability. The power cable can be stored in the cable storage or on a pull-out cable hook for convenience when changing rooms frequently. The suction hose on the unit has a simple but effective plug-in clip system that ensures  the suction hose does not become detached when the unit is pulled along behind the user. The new clip system allows an easy extension of the suction hose for cleaning steps and stairways. A power brush converts the unit to a brush-type vacuum cleaner. In cases where hygienic standards are stringent, a HEPA filter can be used with the paper filter bag.","The Kärcher T 12/1 is an efficient and quiet vacuum cleaner perfect for contract cleaners, hotels, restaurants, offices, shops, hospitals and private households.",Technical data                                                                                                                           Air flow                                                                                                                                                                                   130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Waterlift                                                                                                                                                                                   98                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Container capacity                                     (gal)                                                                                                                                              3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Power                                     (hp)                                                                                                                                              1.7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Standard nominal width                                                                                                                                                                                   1.25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Length of cord access.
