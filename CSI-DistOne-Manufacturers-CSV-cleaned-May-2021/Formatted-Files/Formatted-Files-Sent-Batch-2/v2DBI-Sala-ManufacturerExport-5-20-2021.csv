It uses high frequency Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to maximize the effectiveness and minimize the total cost of your safety program. i-Safe™ allows you to easily record and access information on inspections, inventory, use and tracks equipment assignments by worker or location. The system also automates the inspection process, with preloaded templates and other tracking information. There are multiple system options available — using a web portal or versions that can be stored on your own equipment or behind your own firewall. This allows for easy access and time-saving information management. In addition, mobile devices are supported for in-the-field, on-site inspections. Almost all new DBI-SALA® fall protection products are delivered from the factory already RFID-enabled. Retrofit tags are also available to outfit existing inventory and other safety equipment. Whether you’re responsible for a single construction site, a manufacturing plant or a series of oil rigs, i-Safe™ makes it easier to manage your safety inspection program.",,Psion Workabout Pro handheld computer with HF RFID reader and cradle with battery charger.,i-Safe™ Reader with Cradle - Psion

This condition can occur when a person remains suspended at height (after a fall) for even short periods of time. Suspension in a harness may cause blood to pool in the veins of the legs which can result in unconsciousness; if not rescued promptly, serious injury or death may occur. The Suspension Trauma Safety Strap is designed to prevent suspension trauma while a worker is awaiting rescue. The Suspension Trauma Safety Strap allows the worker, who is suspended, to stand up in their harness and to relieve the pressure being applied to the arteries and veins around the top of the legs. The continuous loop design allows both sides of the harness to relieve the pressure being applied to the legs. The strap accommodates either having one foot or both feet in the loop at a time - it will relieve the pressure to both sides with just one foot in allowing for added movement of the legs.

For convenience, the 38” drink tube can emerge from dual hose ports for access from either shoulder, and the tube clip ensures it stays out of the worker’s way. This also keeps the no-leak bite valve near the worker’s mouth for hands-free access.

Cranes and other overhead machinery are then free to pass. The Power Tagline system can be easily operated by one person. It can be remotely operated to lower the overhead mounted SRL’s lifeline to the floor, allowing the worker to connect it to their harness.

These forms typically consist of a series of trusses which support a forming deck. Once a ?oor is poured the truss supports are lowered from the pour, pulled from the building, and ?own, using a crane, to the top of the building to repeat the process for the next ?oor. While the workers are placing the forming deck they are exposed to falls of greater than 6 ft. (1.8m). It becomes very dif?cult to protect the workers using standard fall protection equipment as no structure exists above the workers to provide an anchorage for tie-off. The new Flying Form Netting System from Capital Safety acts as a passive fall protection system that can be attached to the form support trusses. Installed at the ?rst level, the netting stays in place and is ?own with the trusses for the duration of the project. Job site ef?ciency is improved because the system does not need to be reinstalled at each ?oor and workers can start placing forming deck immediately after the forms are positioned. Multiple Flying Form Netting Systems can be joined together with the included Snap Hooks to ensure maximum jobsite ?exibility.",,"Flying form personnel net system for concrete construction, specify size needed.",Sinco™ Flying Form Net

Designed for use with traditional cable set-ups, our vertical debris nets attach to the cable with supplied or available Zip Clips. The bottom edge of the net is quickly secured using a power actuated tool to fire the nail into the tie-down plate. The nets are supplied in 100 ft. (30.5 m) lengths in your choice of 48 in. (122 cm) or 66"" (168 cm) heights. Removing and relocating the system is simple, saving you time and money by removing the Zip Clips and prying the nails out of the tie-down plates with a hammer.
