They simply combine the very popular DBD-32X bender with the DC-25WH or DC-32X rebar cutter both together on a stationary stand.  The main advantage to owning this versatile combination unit is that the rebar cutter can be easily removed and used in any portable application or locked into a stationary position and then operated by a standard foot pedal switch.  The other advantage is production; the bender table is at the ideal working height and the DBD-32X bends rebar from 0 -180 degrees.  The BCSE-32X combination stand joins the bender & cutter both together.,,Benner-Nawman DBC-3225 & DBC-3232 Combination Rebar Bender and Cutter Units,Combination Rebar Bender and Cutter Units
