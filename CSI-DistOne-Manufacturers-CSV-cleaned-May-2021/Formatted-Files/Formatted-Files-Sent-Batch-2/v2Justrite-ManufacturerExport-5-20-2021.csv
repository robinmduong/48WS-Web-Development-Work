Rags and cloths soaked with solvents, thinners, linseed oil, combustible adhesives and other flammable liquids present a serious fire risk when improperly discarded. The specially designedlid opens no more than 60 degrees and stays closed when not in use, isolating contents from fire sources and limiting oxygen so spontaneous combustion risk is virtually eliminated. Round construction and elevated bottom encourage circulation of air around can to disperse heat and reduce moisture buildup and rusting.",,,9300 Justrite 10 Gal Oily Waste Can w/ Foot Operated Cover,10 Gal Oily Waste Can w/ Foot Operated Cover
