Meadows,VOC COMPLIANT Form Release Agent,"FEATURES AND BENEFITS Provides a better and cleaner cast when applied on pre-stressed and pre-cast concrete forms Cuts stripping time to an absolute minimum Reduces form cleaning and repairing Increases wood form life...prevents rust...and rustproofs metal forms Effectively minimizes concrete build-up on pavers, R/M trucks, mixers, spreader-finishers, buggies, chutes and other equipment Prevents bonding between poured concrete and the form Breaks concrete bond between the surface and the form cleanly and effectively...leaves smooth surface Will not stain or discolor concrete and can be painted over Ready-to-use...requires no additional mixing VOC compliant","USES DUOGARD can be used on various types of forms (wood, steel, fiberglass and aluminum, as well as fiber tubes). Wood forms should be saturated prior to first use. DUOGARD increases the life of wood forms by penetrating into the wood to waterproof and prevent deterioration. It also reduces maintenance requirements on metal forms by forming a rustproof film that makes the metal form essentially self-cleaning and rust-free. DUOGARD should be applied to fiber tube forms even though they may be pre-coated. Tubes will strip much easier, even 60 to 90 days later. If tubes are stripped in 5 to 10 days, hand rubbing is greatly facilitated when tubes are coated with DUOGARD. DUOGARD also cuts machine clean up time because it minimizes concrete build-up. Pavers, trucks, mixers, spreader-finishers, buggies, chutes and other types of equipment should be sprayed daily with DUOGARD for easy clean up and rust prevention. DUOGARD can be applied on forms for pre-stressed and pre-cast concrete to produce a better and cleaner cast. The product will not stain or discolor concrete. DUOGARD is also available in a true water-base formula, DUOGARD II (Refer to Data Sheet No. 311). DESCRIPTION DUOGARD Multi-Reactive Form Release is composed of an organic chemical that reacts with the alkali content of concrete to form a release film that effectively prevents the bonding of the concrete to the form. In addition, the product also contains a high molecular weight and a non-reactive, chemically inert ingredient to assist in clean, quick, form release and removal. These exclusive ingredients combine the effectiveness of a chemically reactive type and an inert barrier type to provide a doubly effective separation... DUO... and the ultimate in form release. DUOGARD meets maximum VOC content of 450 g/L for Form Release Compounds as required by the U.S. EPA Architectural Coatings Rule.

When properly applied, LIQUI-HARD will offer substantial improvement in abrasion and chemical resistance and will significantly improve the durability of the concrete surface when compared to untreated concrete. As LIQUI-HARD is applied and penetrates into the concrete surface, a chemical reaction takes place, producing a byproduct that fills in the pores of the concrete.  This process produces a substantially denser concrete surface with enhanced durability.  In addition to the densifying and hardening action, LIQUI-HARD also solidifies the concrete, eliminating dusting and pitting.","Uses: LIQUI-HARD is recommended for use wherever hardened, dustproofed, and improved chemical and abrasion resistant surfaces are required. Ideal applications include floors in industrial plants and warehouses, storage silos, sewage plants, chemical processing facilities, refineries, and heavy pedestrian floor traffic areas, such as civic centers, sports arenas, stadiums, hospitals, airports, and museums.

PERMINATOR 10 mil is also ideal for use over horizontal applications of MEL-ROL® LM. DESCRIPTION PERMINATOR underslab vapor barrier is a new generation of polyolefin-based resin/chemical technology. PERMINATOR provides the vapor barrier industry with a highly effective, economical choice for helping to reduce the penetration of moisture and water vapor through the slab into the structure, thereby helping to reduce fungus, mildew, and mold growth. PERMINATOR also helps reduce radon gas from entering the structure. PERMINATOR is tough enough to withstand normal construction jobsite conditions and traffic. It will not crack, puncture, snag, split, or tear easily. PERMINATOR helps meet and maintain the maximum slab moisture transfer rate of 3 lb./1000 ft.²/24 hours, as allowed by the flooring industry's specifications. PERMINATOR is available in 10 mil and 15 mil thicknesses. Both versions are furnished in 200' (61 m) long rolls. PERMINATOR's 12' wide (15 mil) and 15' wide (10 mil) rolls require fewer seams in application. Installation is quick and easy. All joints/seams, both side and end, should be overlapped 6"" and taped using 4"" wide PERMINATOR TAPE. PERMINATOR rolls fast and smoothly over level tamped soil or compacted fill. PACKAGING 10 mil: 15' wide (4.57 m), 200' long (60.96 m) or 54"" wide (1.37 m), 400' long (121.92 m) by special order only. 15 mil: 12' wide (3.66 m), 200' long (60.96 m) SPECIFICATIONS Meets or exceeds all requirements of ASTM E 1745-09 Class A, B & C.",,"Vapor Barrier Tape 4"" x 180' Roll","Vapor Barrier Tape 4"" x 180' Roll"

Meadows,55-Gal Drum Duogard VOC Form Release,"FEATURES AND BENEFITS Provides a better and cleaner cast when applied on pre-stressed and pre-cast concrete forms Cuts stripping time to an absolute minimum Reduces form cleaning and repairing Increases wood form life...prevents rust...and rustproofs metal forms Effectively minimizes concrete build-up on pavers, R/M trucks, mixers, spreader-finishers, buggies, chutes and other equipment Prevents bonding between poured concrete and the form Breaks concrete bond between the surface and the form cleanly and effectively...leaves smooth surface Will not stain or discolor concrete and can be painted over Ready-to-use...requires no additional mixing VOC compliant","USES DUOGARD can be used on various types of forms (wood, steel, fiberglass and aluminum, as well as fiber tubes). Wood forms should be saturated prior to first use. DUOGARD increases the life of wood forms by penetrating into the wood to waterproof and prevent deterioration. It also reduces maintenance requirements on metal forms by forming a rustproof film that makes the metal form essentially self-cleaning and rust-free. DUOGARD should be applied to fiber tube forms even though they may be pre-coated. Tubes will strip much easier, even 60 to 90 days later. If tubes are stripped in 5 to 10 days, hand rubbing is greatly facilitated when tubes are coated with DUOGARD. DUOGARD also cuts machine clean up time because it minimizes concrete build-up. Pavers, trucks, mixers, spreader-finishers, buggies, chutes and other types of equipment should be sprayed daily with DUOGARD for easy clean up and rust prevention. DUOGARD can be applied on forms for pre-stressed and pre-cast concrete to produce a better and cleaner cast. The product will not stain or discolor concrete. DUOGARD is also available in a true water-base formula, DUOGARD II (Refer to Data Sheet No. 311). DESCRIPTION DUOGARD Multi-Reactive Form Release is composed of an organic chemical that reacts with the alkali content of concrete to form a release film that effectively prevents the bonding of the concrete to the form. In addition, the product also contains a high molecular weight and a non-reactive, chemically inert ingredient to assist in clean, quick, form release and removal. These exclusive ingredients combine the effectiveness of a chemically reactive type and an inert barrier type to provide a doubly effective separation... DUO... and the ultimate in form release. DUOGARD meets maximum VOC content of 450 g/L for Form Release Compounds as required by the U.S. EPA Architectural Coatings Rule.
