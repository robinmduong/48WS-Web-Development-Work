22006,Structural and Spud Wrenches,423,Rev,,E:\IMAGES\ITEMS\product\4\2\leatherman-tool-group-423-rev.jpg,Leatherman Tool Group,,"Introducing the Leatherman Rev.  This all-new multi-tool allows you to grab a toolbox full of functionality and keep it at your fingertips, no matter where you might be: under the hood, at the campground, finishing honey-do projects around the house or cracking open a cold one at the tailgate.  The Rev features 14 soon-to-be-indispensable tools, an outside accessible 420HC blade and a replaceable pocket clip for easy carry, and as always is backed by the Leatherman 25-year warranty. 																			 																																		Locking Blade												A knife blade that locks into place when fully deployed. A user must manually unlock the blade to fold it away, which allows for a much safer user experience.																																								 																																		Replaceable Pocket Clip												A removable clip which allows the user to wear their multi-tool attached to a pocket or belt loop without the use of a sheath. By removing the clip, the user is able to easily carry their tool in a sheath if preferred.																																								 																																		Outside-accessible Features												This multi-tool features tools that are accessible while the tool is in its folded or closed position, mimicking the functionality of a pocket knife.",,,,Rev
22006,Structural and Spud Wrenches,32,Z-Rex,,E:\IMAGES\ITEMS\product\3\2\leatherman-tool-group-32-z-rex.jpg,Leatherman Tool Group,,"There are other glass breakers and strap cutters on the market, but Z-Rex is the first one to pull together all the one-off features into one lightweight, intuitive and comfortable-to-use tool. Replaceable and indexible V-notch cutters can simply be flipped around for a fresh edge on-the-spot, or replaced completely when you're back home. Two wrenches—oxygen and Hex—are built right into the body of the tool; and, while other companies use stainless steel that takes much more force (if it even works at all) we use one-strike, Tungsten Carbide for our glass breaker tool. After all, if you're down to breaking glass, this is not the time to be beating your fist against the window.  The Z-Rex MOLLE sheath is included. 																			 																																		Finger Hole												A space to loop the tool over a finger, allowing the user to keep a firm grip on the tool when in use in wet or slippery conditions, or when breaking glass.																																								 																																		Ergo Grip												The shape of the tool allows the user to keep a safe, solid and comfortable grip on the tool while in use.",,,,Z-Rex
22006,Structural and Spud Wrenches,49,OHT,,E:\IMAGES\ITEMS\product\4\9\leatherman-tool-group-49-oht.jpg,Leatherman Tool Group,,"For years multi-tool users could choose from two distinct options when it came to a ""one-hand-operable"" multi-tool: one-hand-opening pliers OR one-hand-opening blades. Today, Leatherman has taken these two well-loved ideas and fused them into the first ever, 100% one-hand-operable multi-tool, the Leatherman OHT. This industry-first tool features spring-loaded pliers and wire-cutters so you don't tire your hand adjusting and readjusting your grip. Handles with visual imprints of the tool beneath make for quick identification. A lifesaving strap cutter and oxygen bottle wrench, threading for common-size cleaning rods and much more make this a one-handed workhorse of a tool. 																			 																																		All Locking Features												All locking features means that every tool and knife on the body of the handle, with the exception of the plier head, will lock into place. Note that the Crunch; however, does feature both all locking tools and plier head. The all locking design enables the user to operate individual tools safely and effectively. By locking them into place when fully open, the user can put pressure on the implement while safely completing the job, before manually unlocking the tool to stow it away.																																								 																																		Jaw Lockout												A feature that locks the plier jaws in place, safely preventing the jaws from slipping into the handles during use.																																								 																																		Outside-accessible Features												This multi-tool features tools that are accessible while the tool is in its folded or closed position, mimicking the functionality of a pocket knife.																																								 																																		One-hand Operable Features												Every feature on this tool can be opened and operated with one hand. This enables the user to keep the other hand free for situations that require multi-tasking or a free hand. 																																								 																																		Imprinted Handle Scales												Handles on this multi-tool are imprinted with images of the tool underneath, allowing a user to easily feel for the correct tool while in dark or limited-visibility situations.",,,,OHT
