They have been certified to comply with ANSI A10.11 and OSHA 1926.500-Subpart M. Forged Snap Hooks Forged steel snap hooks are lashed into place every 48-inches.

Fire Retardant PearlWeave's exclusive latex flame retardant treatment is unique in that it can be added to our standard Personnel Safety Net and Debris Netting coating. As a result, only our nets can pass NFPA 701 without a decrease in overall net performance.",,"Pearlweave Safety Netting 48"" x 150"" Safety Netting Premium Orange","48"" x 150"" Premium Orange"
