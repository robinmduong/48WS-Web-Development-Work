See General Notes.  Install before concrete pour with a StrapMate, or other holding device. Nail strap from the bottom up. Strap may be bent one full cycle (bent horizontal 90° then bent vertical) to aid wall placement, but may cause spalling behind the strap. If the spall is 1"" or less, measured from the embedment line to the bottom of the spall, full loads apply. 1"" to 4"" spalls for LSTHD8 achieve 0.9 times table loads. STHD10 and STHD14 achieve full load for spalls less than 4"". Any portion of the strap left exposed should be protected against corrosion. Other than where noted in the two-pour detail, do not install where: (a) a horizontal cold joint exists within the embedment depth between the slab and foundation wall or footing beneath, unless provisions are made to transfer the load, or the slab is designed to resist the load imposed by the anchor; or  (b) slabs are poured over concrete block foundation walls. Additional studs attached to the shearwall studs or post may be required by the Designer for wall sheathing nailing.

The anchor is set by driving the expansion plug towards the bottom of the anchor using the setting tool. Drop-in anchors are also available in coilthreaded versions for 1/2"" and 3/4"" coil threaded rod.  The Lipped Drop-In (DIAL) features a lip at the top of the anchor body that keeps the top of the anchor flush with the concrete. This eliminates the need for precisely drilled hole depths and allows for easier flush installation, consistent embedment and uniform rod lengths.  Short Drop-In anchors are for use in solid and hollow concrete. The short length permits shallow embedment that helps to avoid drilling into rebar or prestressing strands. The wide surface flange enables the Short Drop-In to be installed in deep or bottomless holes. Fixed-depth drill bits are also available to take the guesswork out of drilling to the correct depth for these 3/8"" and 1/2"" Short Drop-Ins. Using the fixeddepth bit drill bit prevents overdrilling, which saves time and prolongs bit life.",,"Size: 5/8""",Drop-In Anchor

Removable: Ideal for temporary anchoring (e.g. formwork, bracing) or applications where fixtures may need to be moved. Re-use of the anchor to achieve listed load values is not recommended. The self-undercutting, non-expansion characteristics of the Titen HD anchor make it ideal for structural applications, even at reduced edge distances and spacings.  Recommended for use in permanent dry, interior, non-corrosive environments or temporary outdoor applications, the Titen HD has been tested to offer industry-leading performance in cracked and uncracked concrete under both static and seismic loading conditions.

Its simple design makes installation intuitive and quick, resulting in lower labor costs. Featuring a versatile, hinged seat, the LSSJ is easily field-adjustable to typical rafter slopes, with a max slope of 12:12. It ships prebent with a 45° skew, making it ready to place for the most typical rafter conditions, and can be field-adjusted for lesser skews. Additionally, it can be installed as a retrofit, enabling installers to first tack all the rafters into place without pausing and to then install the hanger later. The LSSJ hanger is available skewed left or skewed right.","Key Features -All nail holes are easily accessible on one side with a hammer or connector nail gun -Straightforward design makes installation quick and intuitive, saving you time and labor costs -Flange design allows for easy skew adjustment, from 0° to 45° -Accommodates roof pitches from 0:12 to 12:12 -Swivel seat adjusts easily and provides more support to joist, allowing for higher load than fasteners alone  Material -18 gauge  Finish -ZMAX® coating (G-185)  Installation -Use all specified fasteners. See General Notes. -Rafter end needs to be bevel cut. -Table and illustration show left and right skews LSSJR/L (LSSJR = skewed right; LSSJL = skewed left).  Options The LSSJ is manufactured in left or right skews as shown in the gallery images (note the “L” or “R” in the model name).
