(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products).   The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!  “Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","Aggressive carbide tips     Deep self-cleaning gullets     Generous cup depth     Extra-long ""Quick Change"" HSS and carbide tipped pilot drills     ""Quick Connect"" Arbor     Easy plug ejection","Catalog #                              Description                                                               Hole Diameter in.

21865,Specialty Pliers,S9R,Hand Seamer with Cast Zinc Jaws,,E:\IMAGES\ITEMS\product\S\9\malco-s9r-hand-seamers-with-cast-zinc-jaws.jpg,Malco,"Malco Hand Seamers, with die cast zinc jaws, are gentle on painted or coated metal surfaces and are ideal for making clean and accurate bends and seams in aluminum roof flashing, coil stock or fascia.  The  Jaws feature depth graduations in 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) increments to a maximum 2-inch (50.8 mm) bending depth. The jaws of these large die cast seamers are bowed so that they will hold firmly and evenly across the entire jaw width even when engaged on very light material.  The large surface coverage of these jaws also has an appeal for limited flattening / straightening tasks in light gauge painted steel including edges of auto body panels.  These Seamers are not warranted for use as a striking tool or for prying or bending heavy ferrous sheet metal.  Durable construction offers long, dependable service life under normal use. These tools also feature rust resistant nickel plating.      Malco’s Hand Seamers, with die cast zinc jaws, also feature ergonomic RedLine Handle technology.  An Engineered handle opening compliments the natural power stroke of any user’s hand and maximizes the powerful 7:1 mechanical advantage of compound-leverage head to handle linkage.  Comfortable handle grip contours, a non-slip grip insert, spring handle actuation and a thumb-operated handle latch ensure a natural fit and feel for comfortable one hand operation anywhere on the job.","Gentle on painted or coated metal surfaces.

The jaws of these large die cast seamers are bowed so that they will hold firmly and evenly across the entire jaw width even when engaged on very light material.  The large surface coverage of these jaws also has an appeal for limited flattening / straightening tasks in light gauge painted steel including edges of auto body panels.  These Seamers are not warranted for use as a striking tool or for prying or bending heavy ferrous sheet metal.  Durable construction offers long, dependable service life under normal use. These tools also feature rust resistant nickel plating.      Malco’s Hand Seamers, with die cast zinc jaws, also feature ergonomic RedLine Handle technology.  An Engineered handle opening compliments the natural power stroke of any user’s hand and maximizes the powerful 7:1 mechanical advantage of compound-leverage head to handle linkage.  Comfortable handle grip contours, a non-slip grip insert, spring handle actuation and a thumb-operated handle latch ensure a natural fit and feel for comfortable one hand operation anywhere on the job.","Gentle on painted or coated metal surfaces.

The jaws of these large die cast seamers are bowed so that they will hold firmly and evenly across the entire jaw width even when engaged on very light material.  The large surface coverage of these jaws also has an appeal for limited flattening / straightening tasks in light gauge painted steel including edges of auto body panels.  These Seamers are not warranted for use as a striking tool or for prying or bending heavy ferrous sheet metal.  Durable construction offers long, dependable service life under normal use. These tools also feature rust resistant nickel plating.      Malco’s Hand Seamers, with die cast zinc jaws, also feature ergonomic RedLine Handle technology.  An Engineered handle opening compliments the natural power stroke of any user’s hand and maximizes the powerful 7:1 mechanical advantage of compound-leverage head to handle linkage.  Comfortable handle grip contours, a non-slip grip insert, spring handle actuation and a thumb-operated handle latch ensure a natural fit and feel for comfortable one hand operation anywhere on the job.","Gentle on painted or coated metal surfaces.

It’s that easy to convert  your power drill to a power shear!    This rugged but inexpensive accessory cuts straight and to the  left and is capable of navigating tight curved patterns and squares in  heavy 20-gauge (1.02 mm) galvanized steel. Blind cuts require only a  1/2”(12.7 mm) starting hole. Cutting applications include both ferrous  and non-ferrous sheet metals, metal roofing/building panels, vinyl,  steel mesh, ductwork, even the thick metal of furnace jackets, equipment  enclosures or automotive body panels. An offset design keeps both hands  away from work surface. Long-wearing hardened jaws are also  replaceable.    For premium performance without the premium price of a dedicated  power shear, TURBOSHEAR is an easy addition to every tool bag.",Inserts  into chuck of A/C or cordless drill     Offset  design saves hands     Navigates  tight patterns and square cuts     Cuts  a variety of building materials     20  gauge capacity in galvanized steel     Cut-away  view     TSDC  Drill Clamp (optional),"Catalog #                              Description                                                               Net Weight oz.

This rugged but inexpensive accessory cuts straight and to the  left and is capable of navigating tight curved patterns and squares in  heavy 20-gauge (1.02 mm) galvanized steel. Blind cuts require only a  1/2”(12.7 mm) starting hole. Cutting applications include both ferrous  and non-ferrous sheet metals, metal roofing/building panels, vinyl,  steel mesh, ductwork, even the thick metal of furnace jackets, equipment  enclosures or automotive body panels. An offset design keeps both hands  away from work surface. Long-wearing hardened jaws are also  replaceable.
