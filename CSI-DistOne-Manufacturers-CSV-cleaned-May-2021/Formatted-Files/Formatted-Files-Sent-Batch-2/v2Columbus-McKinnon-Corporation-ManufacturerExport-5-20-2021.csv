BUILT TO LAST Lightweight aluminum housing withstands rigorous use and features high-quality, long-lasting bearings. Powder coat finish provides extra protection in harsh environments. MEETS ASME B30.21 EXCELLENT CORROSION PROTECTION Robust chain guide and chain stripper made from cast steel and zinc-plated for corrosion protection. 100% LOAD TESTED ZINC-PLATED CHAIN Protects against corrosion. EASY-TO-INSPECT SWIVEL HOOKS Bolt-on hooks with nylon locks help users comply with ASME B30.21 and B30.10 inspection requirements. Hooks are forged, allowing them to yield under overload without breaking. Cast safety latches provide positive and secure load engagement. INDUSTRY-LEADING WARRANTY Our lifetime warranty on all mechanical components, including the Sidewinder lever handle, is the industry's best warranty against manufacturing and material defects. With our 3-year brake warranty, if the brake discs wear out within 3 years from the date of purchase, CMCO will replace the ratchet disc assembly free of charge. EASY IDENTIFICATION Each unit has a unique serial number for easy and accurate identification.","SIDEWINDER LEVER HANDLE This first-of-its-kind lever handle design will revolutionize the ratchet lever hoist industry. Its unique foldable handle and 360° rotating lever increases productivity while reducing the risk of operator injury. CONVENIENT DIRECTIONAL INDICATOR Easy-to-use, highly visible directional indicator located on the handle clearly shows the operating direction as lifting, lowering or neutral.
