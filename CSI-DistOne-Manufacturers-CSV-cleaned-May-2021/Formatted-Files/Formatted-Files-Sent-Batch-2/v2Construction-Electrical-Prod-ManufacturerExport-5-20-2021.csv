CEP's Metal Halide lights are mounted in a heavy duty steel yoke, providing impact resistance when in use or when transporting to another location. All models are special ordered in other voltages. Metal Halide lights require a warm-up time of 4-5 minutes for full illumination. A cool-down time of 5-15 minutes is recommended after shutdown to re-light. These lights will not work without a ballast assembly. Ballasts sold separately.
