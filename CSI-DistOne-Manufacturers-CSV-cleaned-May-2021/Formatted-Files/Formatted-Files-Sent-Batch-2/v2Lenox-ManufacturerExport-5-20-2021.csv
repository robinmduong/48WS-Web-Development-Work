This configuration results in a blade that makes precise cuts while resisting breakage. M42, also known as high speed steel (HSS), provides good wear resistance and can be used in general purpose applications for both ferrous and nonferrous materials. The cutting surface of a toothed edge is composed of a row of pointed teeth. Common tooth variations include the number of teeth per inch and pitch pattern. They are used on ferrous and nonferrous materials.","Blade Material	Bi-Metal Tip/Edge Material	M42 Tooth Material	M 42 HSS Blade Length (Feet)	10' 5"" Teeth Per Inch	4-6 Blade Width (Inch)	1 Blade Thickness (Decimal Inch)	0.0350 Cutting Edge Style	Toothed Edge",8247247451.0,,LENOX CLASSIC 10FT 5INX1 035 4/6T 47451
