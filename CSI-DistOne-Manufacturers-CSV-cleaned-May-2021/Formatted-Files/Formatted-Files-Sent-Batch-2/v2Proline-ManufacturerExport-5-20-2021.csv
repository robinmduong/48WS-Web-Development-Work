It started an entire industry of seamless texture skins. Seamless textures are preferred by contractors and homeowners because they are easy to apply, can be done in less time than pattern concrete, allows for a clean look with less grout lines and produces a long lasting beautiful addition to your home. Granite is a plutonic rock of the Earth's crust, formed by the cooling of magma into a lovely textured stone. Developed from real rock, Proline's Seamless Old Granite Cleft Stone resembles the natural stone adding the benefit of lower cost, higher durability and inherent strength and endurance. Old Granite Cleft Stone has a ""signature"" vein that sets it apart from all others.
