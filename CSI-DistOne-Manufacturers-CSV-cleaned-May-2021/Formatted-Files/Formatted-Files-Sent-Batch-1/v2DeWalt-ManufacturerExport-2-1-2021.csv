DeWalt says the DCN692 requires minimal maintenance, and works in cold weather where gas cartridges fail.   With dual-speed settings optimized for different nail lengths, users of the new gas-free framing nailer can select between Speed Setting 1 when driving shorter nails (2 in. to 3 in.) for lower vibration (which can cause user fatigue), increased shots per charge, and increased application speed (compared with Speed Setting 2), or Speed Setting 2 when driving longer nails for the speed and power to drive nails consistently, similar to a pneumatic nailer.  The gas-free cordless framing nailer combines DeWalt’s brushless motor technology with the XR 4.0AH lithium ion battery pack to allow driving up to 700 nails per charge, making it ideal for heavy duty carpentry and framing professionals, such as general builders, remodelers, and installers of decks and fencing, according to the manufacturer.",,20V MAX Cordless,DeWalt Gas-Free Nailer

Working Range- 165 feet Range 50 feet, range with detector, 4 AA batteries for 30 hours of run-time","The DEWALT DW089K Line Laser features multiple design enhancements to improve productivity on the job site. The DW089K is ideal for professionals tasked with residential and commercial applications such as installing cabinets, drop ceilings, chair rails or doors and windows. Unlike many line lasers on the market, the DW089K features a second plumb line that forms a 90-Degree intersecting line on the floor and ceiling. This third vertical beam allows contractors to use the tool for layout applications without the need for a second laser, saving time and allowing users to be as productive as possible. For commercial wall layout applications, the DW089K has a track clearance of over 1-3/4-Inch, which means there is no need for additional accessories to raise the laser over drywall track. This Line Laser also has a micro adjust knob for easy alignment, a metal roll cage for durability, and an integrated pivot bracket and universal wall mount that is ideal for acoustical ceiling installation. The micro adjust knob is especially important in that it allows users to steadily adjust the 90-Degree layout lines in small increments without the need to nudge the laser to hit a specific mark. For improved visibility, the beam on the DW089K is two-times brighter than the beam on DEWALT's current line laser. The brighter beam provides increased visibility over long distances as well as in direct sunlight. Accurate within 1/8 of an inch at 30-Feet, the DW089K allows contractors to feel confident in their results when using this product. To alleviate the difficulty professionals often experience when they try to access control panels on the rear of existing units. This is a Class 2 laser product, Power output = 1.5mW.",88591123141.0,,DEWALT DW089K SELF LEVELING 3 BEAM LINE LASER

The DCE200 is capable of completing a full range of presses and is compatible with a wide range of crimping heads and attachments for different materials and applications (Please see compatibility chart for compatible attachments). The head of the tool pivots 360° to maneuver in tight spaces and the crimping jaws have a black galvanized coating to help protect from corrosion. The unit features Crimp Connect™ software, an onboard intelligence system integrated into the tool that provides detailed reports of the date, time, force, and successfully completed cycles of the presses completed by the tool as well as the tools calibration and service history.
