The bus scaffold work platforms are designed to provide a semi-stationary structure around the bus.  Each work platform is packed full of safety conscious features such as toe boards, locking gates, guardrails, stairs with railings, expanded metal floors, and locking casters.  Toe boards are helpful in preventing tools and materials from falling to the ground.  The locking gates create transitions from section to section as well as creating a completely enclosed perimeter around the walkboard.  The stairs include a sturdy railing which provides a much safer option than traditional ladders for hauling tools and materials.  The walkboards can be made from either expanded metal or 5/8” plywood.","","","","Bus / Truck / RV Maintenance Platform",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
