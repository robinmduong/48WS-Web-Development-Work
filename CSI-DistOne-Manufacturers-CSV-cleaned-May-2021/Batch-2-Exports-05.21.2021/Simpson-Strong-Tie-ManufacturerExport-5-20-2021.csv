<li>Blue Banger Hanger® internally-threaded inserts are cast into the underside of the concrete deck after being fastened to the top of wood forms or metal deck.</li>
<li>Once the concrete has cured, the anchor provides an attachment point for threaded rod used to hang electrical, mechanical and plumbing utilities.</li>
<li>Available in versions for metal decks, wood forms and roof decks, the Blue Banger Hanger insert is the only pre-pour insert to offer the patented multi-thread design which allows one size insert to handle multiple diameters of threaded rod.</li>
</br>
<b>Features:</b></br>
<li>Quick and easy installation saves time and money with no assembly required</li>
<li>Patented multi-thread design enables each hanger to accept multiple diameters of threaded rod. Three sizes of hangers can handle all applications, reducing contractor and distributor inventories</li>
<li>Multi-thread design enables threaded rod size to be changed after the anchor is in the concrete</li>
<li>Machined steel insert with large flanged head provides high tension and shear loads for overhead attachments</li>
<li>Positive attachment to form keeps the hanger vertical and in the correct position</li>
<li>Internal threads eliminate the cost of rod couplers</li>
<li>Head stamped with the Simpson Strong-Tie® &quot;?&quot; symbol for easy identification before the concrete pour</li>

<li>ETI injection epoxies are two-component, high-solids formulations that are dispensed through a static mixing nozzle using a manual, battery or pneumatic 
dispensing tool.</li>
<li>ETI injection epoxies are specially designed formulations for the injection of cracks in concrete.</li>
<li>Properly installed, they provide a repair that is both waterproof and high strength (structural).</li>
</br>
<b>Features:</b>
<li>Chemically bonds with the concrete to provide a structural repair</li>
<li>Seals the crack from moisture, protecting rebar in the concrete from corrosion and flooring from moisture damage</li>
<li>All viscosities formulated for maximum penetration under pressure</li>
<li>Side-by-side cartridge dispensing provides reliable mixing and ratio control when used with the Simpson Strong-Tie® Opti-Mix® static mixing nozzle (included)</li>
<li>Eliminates the need for expensive bulk dispensing equipment</li>
<li>Formulations can be dispensed using a manual or pneumatic dispensing tool (ETI-LV requires the use of the Opti-Mix nozzle, model EMNO22, which is included with the cartridge)</li>
<li>Final color of product: Amber</li>
<li>Suitable for pressure injection or gravity-feed applications</li>
<li>Non-shrink material resistant to oils, salts and mild chemicals</li>
</br>
<b>Applications:</b>
<li>Meets the requirements of ASTM C881, Type I, IV and V, Grade 1, Classes B and C</li>
<li>For repair of fine to medium-width cracks that are 1/64&quot; – 1/4&quot; in width</li>
<li>Low surface tension allows the material to effectively penetrate narrow cracks</li>
<li>Suitable for structural repairs</li>

<li>Code-listed under the current IBC/IRC in accordance with AC193 for cracked concrete applications per ICC-ES ESR-2713
<li>Code-listed under the current IBC/IRC in accordance with AC106 for masonry applications per ICC-ES ESR-1056
<li>Thread design undercuts to efficiently transfer the load to the base material
<li>Specialized heat-treating process creates tip hardness for better cutting without compromising the ductility that helps prevent breakage
<li>No special drill bit needed: Designed to install using standard-sized ANSI tolerance drill bits
<li>Installs with 50% less torque: Testing shows that when compared to competitors, the Titen HD requires 50% less torque to be installed in concrete
<li>Hex-washer head: Requires no separate washer and provides a clean installed appearance.
<li>Removable: Ideal for temporary anchoring (e.g. formwork, bracing) or applications where fixtures may need to be moved. Re-use of the anchor to achieve listed load values is not recommended.</li>
<li>The self-undercutting, non-expansion characteristics of the Titen HD anchor make it ideal for structural applications, even at reduced edge distances and spacings.</li>
<li> Recommended for use in permanent dry, interior, non-corrosive environments or temporary outdoor applications, the Titen HD has been tested to offer industry-leading performance in cracked and uncracked concrete under both static and seismic loading conditions.</li>
<li><i>Some jurisdictions require an additional square plate washer for sill plate applications.</i></li>

The SD structural-connector screw features an optimized shank which is specifically designed to be compatible with the fastener holes in Simpson Strong-Tie connectors. The hex head virtually eliminates cam-out and helps avoid stripping of the head during installation. The sharp point of the screw enables fast starts, and the patented serrated threads reduce torque for improved drivability.

Its simple design makes installation intuitive and quick, resulting in lower labor costs. Featuring a versatile, hinged seat, the LSSJ is easily field-adjustable to typical rafter slopes, with a max slope of 12:12. It ships prebent with a 45° skew, making it ready to place for the most typical rafter conditions, and can be field-adjusted for lesser skews. Additionally, it can be installed as a retrofit, enabling installers to first tack all the rafters into place without pausing and to then install the hanger later. The LSSJ hanger is available skewed left or skewed right.

","Key Features
-All nail holes are easily accessible on one side with a hammer or connector nail gun
-Straightforward design makes installation quick and intuitive, saving you time and labor costs
-Flange design allows for easy skew adjustment, from 0° to 45°
-Accommodates roof pitches from 0:12 to 12:12
-Swivel seat adjusts easily and provides more support to joist, allowing for higher load than fasteners alone

Material
-18 gauge

Finish
-ZMAX® coating (G-185)

Installation
-Use all specified fasteners. See General Notes.
-Rafter end needs to be bevel cut.
-Table and illustration show left and right skews LSSJR/L (LSSJR = skewed right; LSSJL = skewed left).

Options
The LSSJ is manufactured in left or right skews as shown in the gallery images (note the “L” or “R” in the model name). Both the LSSJL and the LSSJR version come prebent at a 45º skew for typical use but can be field-adjusted to install from 0° to 45°.","","Field-Adjustable Jack Hanger","Field-Adjustable Jack Hanger",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,

In certain applications screws are easier and more convenient to install than nails, and the single-fastener load values achieved by the SD screw exceed those of typical 10d common or 16d common nails. In addition, the galvanized coating makes the SD screw ideal for interior and most exterior conditions.

<li>Tested and approved for use in many of our most popular connectors for both interior and exterior applications.</li>
<li>Ideal for use in connector applications where more control is desired or using a hammer is inconvenient.</li>

The load-rated SD screw has been tested and approved for use in many popular Simpson Strong-Tie products. In certain applications screws are easier and more convenient to install than nails, and the single-fastener load values achieved by the SD screw exceed those of typical 10d common or 16d common nails. In addition, the galvanized coating makes the SD screw ideal for interior and most exterior conditions.
