The cast aluminum shear housing is now equipped with close-clearance, heavy-duty cutting blades that are essential for handling thin sheet. Thus, the P-2042 is more than capable of shearing through light shim stock and up to 16-gauge steel with the same smooth cutting action.

The P-2042 features the Kett 2500 RPM pneumatic power unit designed for maximum efficiency at 90 PSI air pressure.

The bronze slider has been replaced by a heavy-duty roller bearing. The old bulky cast plunger has been replaced by a lighter yoke. These changes have resulted in smoother operation and better parts life. The plunger, die holder and punch have been completely re-designed: a screw-on punch retainer provides easy access to the punch. Replacing the punch is now a breeze, no more tedious aligning access holes and working inside the tool. Just unfasten two screws and pick out the punch from the external T-slot. The new style symmetrical-punch provides two cutting edges. When the first edge gets dull, just turn it around and get DOUBLE PUNCH LIFE. For better tool handling, the front handle with a comfortable non-flip rubber grip has been added. It also serves as an additional support when servicing the tool in an upside down position.
