(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

(57 mm) cup depth make “Quick Action” Hole Saws versatile for cutting through a variety of thick or layered wood, wall tile, fiberglass, plastic and tough fiber-cement siding (including popular James Hardie fiber-cement products). 

The full selection of “Quick Action” Hole Saws (19 sizes in all) share a unique “Quick Connect” Arbor design that is compatible with industry standard 5/8-18 hole saw threads. The arbor easily holds or releases Malco “Quick Change” Pilot Drills. The arbor’s quick release feature also ejects saw plugs with ease!

“Quick Change” Pilot Drills are available in both high speed steel and carbide tipped designs and feature a built-in 10 mm hex shank for tight gripping in a 1/2 in. (12.7 mm) drill. The extra length of these pilot drills allows the drill point to extend 1 in. (25.4 mm) out from the hole saw cup teeth for cutting uneven surfaces like lap siding. Cutting a vent hole in the rim joist or outside wall of a house clad in fiber-cement siding is a breeze!","<li>Aggressive carbide tips</li>

The jaws of these large die cast seamers are bowed so that they will hold firmly and evenly across the entire jaw width even when engaged on very light material.  The large surface coverage of these jaws also has an appeal for limited flattening / straightening tasks in light gauge painted steel including edges of auto body panels.  These Seamers are not warranted for use as a striking tool or for prying or bending heavy ferrous sheet metal.  Durable construction offers long, dependable service life under normal use. These tools also feature rust resistant nickel plating.  



Malco’s Hand Seamers, with die cast zinc jaws, also feature ergonomic RedLine Handle technology.  An Engineered handle opening compliments the natural power stroke of any user’s hand and maximizes the powerful 7:1 mechanical advantage of compound-leverage head to handle linkage.  Comfortable handle grip contours, a non-slip grip insert, spring handle actuation and a thumb-operated handle latch ensure a natural fit and feel for comfortable one hand operation anywhere on the job.","<li>Gentle on painted or coated metal surfaces.</li>

The jaws of these large die cast seamers are bowed so that they will hold firmly and evenly across the entire jaw width even when engaged on very light material.  The large surface coverage of these jaws also has an appeal for limited flattening / straightening tasks in light gauge painted steel including edges of auto body panels.  These Seamers are not warranted for use as a striking tool or for prying or bending heavy ferrous sheet metal.  Durable construction offers long, dependable service life under normal use. These tools also feature rust resistant nickel plating.  



Malco’s Hand Seamers, with die cast zinc jaws, also feature ergonomic RedLine Handle technology.  An Engineered handle opening compliments the natural power stroke of any user’s hand and maximizes the powerful 7:1 mechanical advantage of compound-leverage head to handle linkage.  Comfortable handle grip contours, a non-slip grip insert, spring handle actuation and a thumb-operated handle latch ensure a natural fit and feel for comfortable one hand operation anywhere on the job.","<li>Gentle on painted or coated metal surfaces.</li>

The jaws of these large die cast seamers are bowed so that they will hold firmly and evenly across the entire jaw width even when engaged on very light material.  The large surface coverage of these jaws also has an appeal for limited flattening / straightening tasks in light gauge painted steel including edges of auto body panels.  These Seamers are not warranted for use as a striking tool or for prying or bending heavy ferrous sheet metal.  Durable construction offers long, dependable service life under normal use. These tools also feature rust resistant nickel plating.  



Malco’s Hand Seamers, with die cast zinc jaws, also feature ergonomic RedLine Handle technology.  An Engineered handle opening compliments the natural power stroke of any user’s hand and maximizes the powerful 7:1 mechanical advantage of compound-leverage head to handle linkage.  Comfortable handle grip contours, a non-slip grip insert, spring handle actuation and a thumb-operated handle latch ensure a natural fit and feel for comfortable one hand operation anywhere on the job.","<li>Gentle on painted or coated metal surfaces.</li>

A lower number of teeth and deeper gullets produce cleaner, more precise cuts resulting in an accurately matched trim edge and tighter seams.



Perfectly tensioned, hardened tool-steel blade assures a flat true run.



Available in 7-1/4” (184 mm) 4-tooth, 10” (254 mm) 6-tooth and 12” (305 mm) 8-tooth configurations for use with the full range of circular saw equipment.



WARNING • Fiber cement contains crystalline silica. Respirable silica contained in cutting dust is known to cause cancer.","null","<table>

A lower number of teeth and deeper gullets produce cleaner, more precise cuts resulting in an accurately matched trim edge and tighter seams.



Perfectly tensioned, hardened tool-steel blade assures a flat true run.



Available in 7-1/4” (184 mm) 4-tooth, 10” (254 mm) 6-tooth and 12” (305 mm) 8-tooth configurations for use with the full range of circular saw equipment.



WARNING • Fiber cement contains crystalline silica. Respirable silica contained in cutting dust is known to cause cancer.","null","<table>

It’s that easy to convert  your power drill to a power shear!



This rugged but inexpensive accessory cuts straight and to the  left and is capable of navigating tight curved patterns and squares in  heavy 20-gauge (1.02 mm) galvanized steel. Blind cuts require only a  1/2”(12.7 mm) starting hole. Cutting applications include both ferrous  and non-ferrous sheet metals, metal roofing/building panels, vinyl,  steel mesh, ductwork, even the thick metal of furnace jackets, equipment  enclosures or automotive body panels. An offset design keeps both hands  away from work surface. Long-wearing hardened jaws are also  replaceable.



For premium performance without the premium price of a dedicated  power shear, TURBOSHEAR is an easy addition to every tool bag.","<li>Inserts  into chuck of A/C or cordless drill</li>

It’s that easy to convert  your power drill to a power shear!



This rugged but inexpensive accessory cuts straight and to the  left and is capable of navigating tight curved patterns and squares in  heavy 20-gauge (1.02 mm) galvanized steel. Blind cuts require only a  1/2”(12.7 mm) starting hole. Cutting applications include both ferrous  and non-ferrous sheet metals, metal roofing/building panels, vinyl,  steel mesh, ductwork, even the thick metal of furnace jackets, equipment  enclosures or automotive body panels. An offset design keeps both hands  away from work surface. Long-wearing hardened jaws are also  replaceable.



For premium performance without the premium price of a dedicated  power shear, TURBOSHEAR is an easy addition to every tool bag.","<li>Inserts  into chuck of A/C or cordless drill</li>

A narrower grip opening accommodates large or small hands to  maximize the powerful leverage of compound handle-to-head linkage.  A  new ambidextrous, one-hand-operation latch is another welcome handle  change to all Max2000 snips and features an ingenious all-metal design  that will not loosen or hang up with repetitive use.  Original Max2000  blade designs remain unchanged and retain the same generous cutting  lengths.  Max2000 hardened alloy steel blades with precision ground  cutting edges ensure a minimal force cut and maximum service life.   Sleek head and handle styling offer superior material flow and maximum  maneuverability.","null","<table>

A lower number of teeth and deeper gullets produce cleaner, more precise cuts resulting in an accurately matched trim edge and tighter seams.



Perfectly tensioned, hardened tool-steel blade assures a flat true run.



Available in 7-1/4” (184 mm) 4-tooth, 10” (254 mm) 6-tooth and 12” (305 mm) 8-tooth configurations for use with the full range of circular saw equipment.



WARNING • Fiber cement contains crystalline silica. Respirable silica contained in cutting dust is known to cause cancer.","null","<table>
