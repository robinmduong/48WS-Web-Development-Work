<b>Benifits</b><ul>
<li>With most garden tools you spend more time sharpening and cleaning rust off them than you spend gardening. Carbonite is a new blade coating that solves that problem. It's 50% stronger and has 20% less friction than titanium nitride coatings and is 100% guaranteed to make you love gardening more than ever. This innovative technology resists corrosion and keep blades sharp longer, so you can shear, lop, prune and saw without worrying about your tools. Carbonite is just another way the Garden IQ series is putting the joy back into gardening.
