The 1100-CLEAR series has been used on both interior and exterior applications where paint, resilient tile, or resilient flooring may be applied later. Because of the wide variety of coatings, paints, adhesives, and toppings available, contact the manufacturer of the flooring system or subsequent coating or topping for application approval over resin-based curing compounds. A small test application is always recommended.<br><br>
<b><u>DESCRIPTION</u></b><br><br>
The 1100-CLEAR series of water-based concrete curing compounds is formulated from hydrocarbon resins and may be used on interior, exterior, vertical, and horizontal concrete surfaces. Once applied, 1100-CLEAR forms a premium-grade membrane that retains an optimum amount of water in freshly placed concrete for complete hydration of the cement.  NOTE: After approximately four weeks, the membrane begins to chemically break down when exposed to UV rays.  The membrane will eventually dissipate from the surface. This process usually takes another 3 - 5 weeks under normal traffic, exposure to UV, and weathering conditions.<br><br>

CC-309-1WS has been used on both interior and exterior applications where paint, resilient tile or resilient flooring was applied later. Because of the wide variety of paints and adhesives for carpeting and resilient tile in use, contact the manufacturer of the flooring system for application approval over resin-type curing compounds. A small test application is also recommended.<br><br>
<b><u>DESCRIPTION</u></b><br><br>
CC-309-1WS water-base concrete curing compound is formulated from hydrocarbon resins and may be used on interior, exterior, vertical and horizontal concrete surfaces. Once applied, it forms a membrane that retains an optimum amount of water present in freshly placed concrete to allow complete hydration of the cement. NOTE: After approximately four weeks, the membrane begins to chemically break down. When the curing cycle is complete, the membrane will eventually wear off the surface. This process usually takes another three to five weeks under normal traffic, UV exposure and weathering conditions.<br><br>
CC-309-1WS meets the maximum Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) content of 350 g/L for concrete curing compounds as required by the U.S. EPA Architectural Coatings Rule.<br><br>

FIBRE EXPANSION JOINT is ideal for use on highways, streets, airport runways, sidewalks, driveways, flatwork and scores of commercial and industrial applications subject to pedestrian and vehicular traffic.<br><br>
<b><u>DESCRIPTION</u></b><br><br>
FIBRE EXPANSION JOINT is composed of cellular fibers securely bonded together and uniformly saturated with asphalt to assure longevity. Wherever a cost-effective joint filler is required, FIBRE EXPANSION JOINT meets the need. Manufactured and marketed by W. R. MEADOWS since the early 1930s, FIBRE EXPANSION JOINT is backed by over 70 years of proven application experience. FIBRE EXPANSION JOINT is versatile, resilient, flexible and non-extruding. When compressed to half of its original thickness, it will recover to a minimum of 70% of its original thickness. FIBRE EXPANSION JOINT will not deform, twist or break with normal on-the-job handling. Breakage, waste and functional failure resulting from the use of inferior, foreign fiber materials can cost you time, dollars and can result in a substandard finished job, generating costly callbacks and rework expenses. However, the purchase and installation of FIBRE EXPANSION JOINT (a small segment of the total project's cost) contributes to both the final cost efficiency and functional success, far greater in proportion than its original cost.<br><br>

DUOGARD can be used on various types of forms (wood, steel, fiberglass and aluminum, as well as fiber tubes). Wood forms should be saturated prior to first use. DUOGARD increases the life of wood forms by penetrating into the wood to waterproof and prevent deterioration. It also reduces maintenance requirements on metal forms by forming a rustproof film that makes the metal form essentially self-cleaning and rust-free.<br><br>
DUOGARD should be applied to fiber tube forms even though they may be pre-coated. Tubes will strip much easier, even 60 to 90 days later. If tubes are stripped in 5 to 10 days, hand rubbing is greatly facilitated when tubes are coated with DUOGARD.<br><br>
DUOGARD also cuts machine clean up time because it minimizes concrete build-up. Pavers, trucks, mixers, spreader-finishers, buggies, chutes and other types of equipment should be sprayed daily with DUOGARD for easy clean up and rust prevention.<br><br>
DUOGARD can be applied on forms for pre-stressed and pre-cast concrete to produce a better and cleaner cast. The product will not stain or discolor concrete. DUOGARD is also available in a true water-base formula, DUOGARD II (Refer to Data Sheet No. 311).<br><br>
<b><u>DESCRIPTION</u></b><br><br>
DUOGARD Multi-Reactive Form Release is composed of an organic chemical that reacts with the alkali content of concrete to form a release film that effectively prevents the bonding of the concrete to the form. In addition, the product also contains a high molecular weight and a non-reactive, chemically inert ingredient to assist in clean, quick, form release and removal. These exclusive ingredients combine the effectiveness of a chemically reactive type and an inert barrier type to provide a doubly effective separation... DUO... and the ultimate in form release. DUOGARD meets maximum VOC content of 450 g/L for Form Release Compounds as required by the U.S. EPA Architectural Coatings Rule.<br><br>

VOCOMP-20 water-based acrylic curing and sealing compound may be quickly and easily applied to simultaneously cure and/or seal new interior or exterior as well as vertical or horizontal concrete surfaces. It is ideal for application on commercial and industrial floors, sidewalks, basement and garage floors, multi-level parking decks, patios, driveways and parking areas. VOCOMP-20 dries very quickly to protect and enhance the natural appearance of concrete.<br><br>
<b><u>DESCRIPTION</u></br>
VOCOMP-20 water-based acrylic curing and sealing compound is formulated using special acrylic polymers in a true water-based carrier. Once properly applied, VOCOMP-20 provides a nearly impermeable seal for efficient moisture retention. VOCOMP-20 appears &quot;milky white&quot; in the container and, when first applied, leaves a &quot;bluish&quot; cast on the concrete for easy visual confirmation of coverage. VOCOMP-20 dries clear to provide a transparent sheen finish. The sheen can be controlled by the number of coats applied. VOCOMP-20 resists yellowing from ultraviolet exposure and provides a durable, long-lasting finish that offers improved resistance to chemicals, petroleum and abrasives.<br><br>
VOCOMP-20 will minimize hair-checking, premature cracking, dusting and spalling. However, good concrete and good concreting practices should be used, as VOCOMP-20 is not a cure-all for improperly mixed or placed concrete. VOCOMP-20 meets the very strict maximum VOC content limits of 100 g/L for sealers as required by certain California Air Pollution Control Districts, as well as the 400 g/L VOC maximum required by the U.S. EPA Architectural Coatings Rule.<br><br>

REZI-WELD 3/2 grout-patch kit is ideal for a variety of construction grouting and patching repair projects. As an epoxy grout, it can be readily poured under base plates or used for anchoring bolts. When applied as a concrete patch, the patching mix serves as a brushed-on primer. The use of a finishing trowel completes the patching application while the primer is still tacky.<br><br>
<b><u>DESCRIPTION</u></b><br><br>
REZI-WELD 3/2 grout-patch is a moisture-insensitive, two-component epoxy kit for grouting, sealing base plates, and patching concrete. Part A, the specially formulated epoxy resin and selected, graded aggregates is premixed and packaged in a five-gallon container. A drop-in tray is provided to hold the separately packaged Part B, or activator. This handy, unitized packaging provides its own mixing vessel. Just open the pail, remove the tray, add the activator to the premixed epoxy-aggregate compound and it's ready to use. It's that easy.<br><br>
<b><u>PACKAGING AND COVERAGE</u></b><br><br>
5 gallon pail yields approximately 0.50 ft.³ (3.75 gallons) of grout/patch when Part A and Part B are completely mixed together.<br><br>

When properly applied, LIQUI-HARD will offer substantial improvement in abrasion and chemical resistance and will significantly improve the durability of the concrete surface when compared to untreated concrete. As LIQUI-HARD is applied and penetrates into the concrete surface, a chemical reaction takes place, producing a byproduct that fills in the pores of the concrete.  This process produces a substantially denser concrete surface with enhanced durability.  In addition to the densifying and hardening action, LIQUI-HARD also solidifies the concrete, eliminating dusting and pitting.","Uses: LIQUI-HARD is recommended for use wherever hardened, dustproofed, and improved chemical and abrasion resistant surfaces are required. Ideal applications include floors in industrial plants and warehouses, storage silos, sewage plants, chemical processing facilities, refineries, and heavy pedestrian floor traffic areas, such as civic centers, sports arenas, stadiums, hospitals, airports, and museums.

<b><u>DESCRIPTION</u></b><br><br>
The 1100-CLEAR series of water-based concrete curing compounds is formulated from hydrocarbon resins and may be used on interior, exterior, vertical, and horizontal concrete surfaces. Once applied, 1100-CLEAR forms a premium-grade membrane that retains an optimum amount of water in freshly placed concrete for complete hydration of the cement.  NOTE: After approximately four weeks, the membrane begins to chemically break down when exposed to UV rays.  The membrane will eventually dissipate from the surface. This process usually takes another 3 - 5 weeks under normal traffic, exposure to UV, and weathering conditions.<br><br>

DUOGARD can be used on various types of forms (wood, steel, fiberglass and aluminum, as well as fiber tubes). Wood forms should be saturated prior to first use. DUOGARD increases the life of wood forms by penetrating into the wood to waterproof and prevent deterioration. It also reduces maintenance requirements on metal forms by forming a rustproof film that makes the metal form essentially self-cleaning and rust-free.<br><br>
DUOGARD should be applied to fiber tube forms even though they may be pre-coated. Tubes will strip much easier, even 60 to 90 days later. If tubes are stripped in 5 to 10 days, hand rubbing is greatly facilitated when tubes are coated with DUOGARD.<br><br>
DUOGARD also cuts machine clean up time because it minimizes concrete build-up. Pavers, trucks, mixers, spreader-finishers, buggies, chutes and other types of equipment should be sprayed daily with DUOGARD for easy clean up and rust prevention.<br><br>
DUOGARD can be applied on forms for pre-stressed and pre-cast concrete to produce a better and cleaner cast. The product will not stain or discolor concrete. DUOGARD is also available in a true water-base formula, DUOGARD II (Refer to Data Sheet No. 311).<br><br>
<b><u>DESCRIPTION</u></b><br><br>
DUOGARD Multi-Reactive Form Release is composed of an organic chemical that reacts with the alkali content of concrete to form a release film that effectively prevents the bonding of the concrete to the form. In addition, the product also contains a high molecular weight and a non-reactive, chemically inert ingredient to assist in clean, quick, form release and removal. These exclusive ingredients combine the effectiveness of a chemically reactive type and an inert barrier type to provide a doubly effective separation... DUO... and the ultimate in form release. DUOGARD meets maximum VOC content of 450 g/L for Form Release Compounds as required by the U.S. EPA Architectural Coatings Rule.<br><br>
