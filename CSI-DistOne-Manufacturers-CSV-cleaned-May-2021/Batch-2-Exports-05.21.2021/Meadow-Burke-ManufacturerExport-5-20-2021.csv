<b>Speed:</b> We know time is money. And with crane and crew waiting, we know that speed of installation is paramount.<br>

a torque requirement and does not need to be retightened.<br>

use. We are confident that the Slam Anchor will be the brace-to-floor connection solution.","The Tilt-Up construction industry has long awaited the arrival of the most heralded brace-to-floor connection solution in recent years.
