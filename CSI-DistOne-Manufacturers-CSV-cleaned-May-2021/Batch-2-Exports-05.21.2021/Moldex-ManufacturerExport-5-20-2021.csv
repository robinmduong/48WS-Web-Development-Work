  AirWave®  — the valve-free respirator that breathes easier:

  Less resistance than other leading disposable respirators*
  Even less exhale resistance than the leading valved respirators*
  

More surface, more airflow
The outstanding performance of
  AirWave®is due to its patented, wave design technology. It allows more airflow in and out of the respirator for cool comfort and  easier breathing. 

      Unique waves double the filter surface area of our comparable respirator 

    
  
      Dura-Mesh®    shell provides bi-directional protection from dirt on the outside  and moisture on the inside
  

Comfort inside and out
By providing more surface area, AirWave ensures cool comfort inside the respirator, without a valve. Plus our exclusive 
  FlexFit®design provides added comfort and compliance over time. 

  
    FlexFit® 
    design expands and contracts as you move and speak, for optimal comfort

    
  Pinch-free molded nose bridge eliminates metal nose-band  readjustment and discomfort

  NIOSH certified under 42CFR84 
  regulations to have a filter efficiency 
  level of 95% or greater against particulate aerosols free of oil up to 10XPEL. 
  Added sorbent helps relieve workers 
  of nuisance levels (less than OSHA 
  Permissible Exposure Limit) of Acid 
  Gas Irritants. The 2500N95 can be used 
  when oil aerosols are not present in 
  industries such as aluminum reduction, 
  paper mills, coal-fired utility plants, 
  petrochemicals, chemical processing 
  and glass etching.
cool and comfortable
 Workers stay cooler with an exhale 
valve that reduces breathing resistance 
and hot air build up. Soft foam nose 
cushion is comfortable. Seals without a 
metal noseband.
Dura-Mesh® shell lasts longer
 The Dura-Mesh® shell protects the 
filter media so it stays cleaner looking 
longer. The shell resists collapsing, even 
in heat and humidity so the respirator 
holds its shape longer. The result is 
fewer respirators used and lower cost.
Applications Hot, humid and dusty environments such as welding, soldering and brazing, grinding, sanding, sweeping, bagging, stone quarrying, metal machining, cement, underground mining, polishing, buffing, lime, poultry and textiles. Aluminum, copper, zinc, brass, bronze smelters, glass etching, paper mills, breweries, fertilizer production, ceramic and clay processing, and chemical processing. No oils present.

  is reduced and workers stay cooler.
Dura-Mesh® shell lasts longer

 The Dura-Mesh® shell protects the filter 
  media so it stays cleaner looking longer. 
  Plus it resists collapsing, even in heat and 
  humidity so the respirator holds its shape 
  longer. The result is fewer respirators 
  used and lower costs.
Applications Hot, humid and dusty environments such as welding, soldering and brazing, grinding, sanding, sweeping, bagging, stone quarrying, metal machining, cement, underground mining, polishing, buffing, lime, poultry and textiles. Welding and foundry operations, lab settings, agriculture, chemical processing, printing, food processing, paint and varnish manufacturing, waste processing and sewage treatment. For oil and non-oil based particulates.

A more comfortable Jazz Band® was achieved by decreasing the band pressure. The end result is greater user fit and comfort which can increase compliance. Workers will want to wear it all day long.

  AirWave®  — the valve-free respirator that breathes easier.
More Surface, More Comfort.
Easier breathing and cool comfort are what you get when you wear an AirWave respirator. The larger surface area of the patented wave design means more air flows in and out of the mask - all without a valve! Easy breathing... by design. 

More Flex, More Durability.
The unique 
  FlexFit®design moves with your mouth for comfort all day long. More comfort means AirWave is a mask that your workers will want to wear, and that means more compliance. Plus the
Dura-Mesh®shell prevents collapsing from heat and humidity so your mask lasts longer.

More Air. More Wear.
When you can breath easier and you're more comfortable, you'll want to keep wearing AirWave! Longer wear means less masks, less masks means more savings. Compliance and cost savings just got easier. Plus it's also metal free.


New Exclusive SmartStrap.
It just keeps on getting better...the new 
  SmartStrap®allows the AirWave to hang from the neck when not in use. So it does not get thrown away and you use fewer masks. Plus its adjustable soft cloth strap feels cool and comfortable. Say goodbye to waste, hello to cost-savings!


Applications

	Hot, humid and dusty environments such as welding, soldering and brazing, grinding, sanding, sweeping, bagging, stone quarrying, metal machining, cement, underground mining, polishing, buffing, lime, poultry and textiles. No oils present. Note: For areas with oils present, you must use an R or P respirator. Call our Technical Support Department for more details.
