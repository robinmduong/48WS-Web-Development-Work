","Proline manufactures the most life-like and beautiful wood planks in the market. This pattern consists of 6&quot; wood planks &quot;ganged&quot; together in a staggered pattern. Each stamp has five rows of 6&quot; wide planks. We suggest you include a &quot;end cap&quot; 6&quot; wide and 4' long, offered in both the rigid and superflex material. At the end of each plank there are two peg holes for added reality. This lovely pattern adorns the Polar Bear exhibit at Sea World, San Diego. Use any of our beautiful Water Based Acrylic Stains and EZ-Tique Water Based Antiquing System colors to add your mark of distinction.

","Proline has designed a new radial stamp, unline any on the market, that can create a radius of infinite dimensions with one affordable set of tools. Even more innovative, this stamp series can create a serpentine cobble, a straight cobble or several band tool designs. This piece, the Double Tool, will create a straight cobblestone by itself. This series is a remarkable value, due to the many looks you can create.
