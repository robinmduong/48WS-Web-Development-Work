Whether you’re restoring power at great heights or working daily on the construction site, you rely on your safety helmet to keep you safe while on the job.

The new line of Ridgeline XR7 Safety Helmets from Pyramex Safety is the company’s latest addition to its trusted Ridgeline series, incorporating expertly designed features like a comfortable breakaway chin strap which secures the hat and offers protection from strangulation should a major fall occur, as well as the ability to attach earmuff and face shield accessories to adapt to the needs of any work environment.

The new Ridgeline XR7 Safety Helmet is constructed of ABS/PC material that’s not only ultra lightweight, it offers superior strength and increased heat resistance. It’s easy to adjust with a 6-point ratchet suspension system ensuring a personalized fit.

A soft four-point PU breakaway chin strap ensures all-day wearing comfort while keeping the helmet securely fastened. Removal is simple with a quick release of the breakaway clip.

Easily adjust height and angle options for the suspension, as well as adjust it from 6-1/2 to 8 head size via an easy to grasp knob to help you find the most comfortable position on your head.

The Ridgeline XR7 meets ANSI Z89.1-2014 Type I, Class E and CE EN 397:2012 +A1:2012 safety standards, so wearers can be confident they are well protected while on the job. Safety helmet adapter, earmuff and face shield accessories are also available (sold separately) to customize the Ridgeline XR7 and adapt to individual working conditions.","","","<ul><li>Blue</li></ul>","Blue Ridgeline XR7 Safety Helmet",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
