These headtops are available as a hood or loose-fitting facepiece in a CC20 Series Airline Respirator configuration or PA20 and PA30 Series Powered Air Purifying Respirator configuration.

PA20LF1
A patented neck cuff design helps maintain positive pressure inside the hood to aid in keeping contaminants out. As air enters the hood, the inner collar inflates, providing a snug, comfortable fit around the neck and continuous flow of air to the worker’s breathing zone. The CC20 hood is lighter and more comfortable than tight-fitting full-facepiece respirators. Covering the entire head, face and neck, the CC20 hood provides splash/overspray protection and makes clean-up quick and easy.
