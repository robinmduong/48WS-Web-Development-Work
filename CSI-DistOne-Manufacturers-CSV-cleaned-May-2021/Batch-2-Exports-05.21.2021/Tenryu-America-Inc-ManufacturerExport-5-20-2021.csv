</p>","<h2>Mel-Pro Series</h2>
<b>The Ultimate Melamine and Veneer-Faced Plywood Cutting Blade</b>
<p>The Mel-Pro Series is a complete line of blades that solve problems associated with cutting melamine and other laminated wood products. Additionally, veneer-faced plywood can be cut without splintering at more reasonable feed speeds than in the past.<br />
FINER CUTS- Precision ground carbide teeth set on hand-tensioned tool steel bodies produce finer cuts without chipping and &quot;bottom-side blowout&quot;.<br />
QUIETER- Patented resin bond-filled expansion slots effectively absorb vibration and reduce noise.<br />
LONGER LIFE- High-grade, extra-hard, micro-grain, anti-corrosive carbide teeth fight both chemical and abrasive wear to remain sharp longer. There are a lot of blades on the market that can cut melamine but only one can really cut it chip free, quieter, easier and longer - the TENRYU Mel-Pro.<br />
Numerous requests for a better melamine blade prompted us to spend over a year of research and development to bring you the world's most advanced melamine cutting blade. The Mel-Pro features a fully hardened, expertly tensioned tool steel body that absorbs impact, remains flat and true, and resists excess heat buildup. The Mel-Pro's exclusive, red bond, resin filled expansion slots absorb vibration, reduce heat and permit the blade to run quieter than any other brand. The thin-kerf, mirror-like grind on super hard, specially designed carbide tips allow for lighter cuts and reduce friction heat buildup. The bottom line is your bottom line will look better when you reduce scrap, reduce sharpening costs and reduce noise in your shop with Mel-Pro blades.</p>

FINER CUTS- Precision ground carbide teeth set on hand-tensioned tool steel bodies produce finer cuts without chipping and &quot;bottom-side blowout&quot;.<br />
QUIETER- Patented resin bond-filled expansion slots effectively absorb vibration and reduce noise.<br />
LONGER LIFE- High-grade, extra-hard, micro-grain, anti-corrosive carbide teeth fight both chemical and abrasive wear to remain sharp longer. There are a lot of blades on the market that can cut melamine but only one can really cut it chip free, quieter, easier and longer - the TENRYU Mel-Pro.<br />
Numerous requests for a better melamine blade prompted us to spend over a year of research and development to bring you the world's most advanced melamine cutting blade. The Mel-Pro features a fully hardened, expertly tensioned tool steel body that absorbs impact, remains flat and true, and resists excess heat buildup. The Mel-Pro's exclusive, red bond, resin filled expansion slots absorb vibration, reduce heat and permit the blade to run quieter than any other brand. The thin-kerf, mirror-like grind on super hard, specially designed carbide tips allow for lighter cuts and reduce friction heat buildup. The bottom line is your bottom line will look better when you reduce scrap, reduce sharpening costs and reduce noise in your shop with Mel-Pro blades.</p>

<p>A Panel-Pro blade for 8&quot; panel saws. Great for laminated woods.
</p>","<h2>TENRYU'S professionals' choice for high performance panel saw cutting. The same, superior features and benefits of our Mel-Pro series in sizes to fit the most popular panel saws.</h2>
<p>Excellent for long lasting, precise cuts in wood, wood composites, and laminated materials on panel saws.<br />
Panel saws are often used to cut large sheets of &quot;difficult&quot; materials like MDF, melamine or particle board. These materials are laden with chemicals and adhesives which attack the carbide causing corrosion of the cutting edge. The Panel-Pro blades come equipped with our best anti-corrosive micro-grain carbide. That, plus our super-flat, perfectly tensioned plate adds up to very precise, long lasting performance on your panel saw!<br />
For cutting aluminum materials on panel saws, see our Alumi-Cut Series blades. For cutting Solid Surface Materials, see our Pro Series for Solid Surface.<br />
Try these blades even without the scoring saw- you'll love the results!</p>
<p>EACH BLADE FEATURES:</p><ul>
<li>Fully-hardened, expertly-tensioned tool steel bodies for true and accurate cuts.</li>
<li>High-grade, extra hard, wear-resistant carbide tips for long life.</li>
<li>Fine grit honing of carbide edges for clean, smooth cuts.</li>
<li>Resin bond-filled expansion slots for reduced vibration and quieter cutting.</li>

<p>For use on popular European panel saws.
</p>","<h2>TENRYU'S professionals' choice for high performance panel saw cutting. The same, superior features and benefits of our Mel-Pro series in sizes to fit the most popular panel saws.</h2>
<p>Excellent for long lasting, precise cuts in wood, wood composites, and laminated materials on panel saws.<br />
Panel saws are often used to cut large sheets of &quot;difficult&quot; materials like MDF, melamine or particle board. These materials are laden with chemicals and adhesives which attack the carbide causing corrosion of the cutting edge. The Panel-Pro blades come equipped with our best anti-corrosive micro-grain carbide. That, plus our super-flat, perfectly tensioned plate adds up to very precise, long lasting performance on your panel saw!<br />
For cutting aluminum materials on panel saws, see our Alumi-Cut Series blades. For cutting Solid Surface Materials, see our Pro Series for Solid Surface.<br />
Try these blades even without the scoring saw- you'll love the results!</p>
<p>EACH BLADE FEATURES:</p><ul>
<li>Fully-hardened, expertly-tensioned tool steel bodies for true and accurate cuts.</li>
<li>High-grade, extra hard, wear-resistant carbide tips for long life.</li>
<li>Fine grit honing of carbide edges for clean, smooth cuts.</li>
<li>Resin bond-filled expansion slots for reduced vibration and quieter cutting.</li>

</p>","<h2>Tenryu Super Diamond Series</h2>
<p>TSD is a new line of products representing a revolution in diamond tooling technology. TENRYU has developed a new method of fusing polycrystalline diamond particles to various shaped tool steels. As a result, very fast cutting rates and longer, effective cutting life is attained.</p>
<p>Currently, this technology is available on a 4&quot; Depressed Center Cup Wheel for grinding applications using 4-1/2&quot;, 5&quot; or 7&quot; right angle grinders.</p>
<p>Also available are 7&quot;, 12&quot; and 14&quot; saw blades (also referred to as Type S-1 wheels). They fit on circular saws, chop saws, and even gas-engine rescue-type saws.</p>
<p>TSD3TSD was originally developed to cut and grind cast-iron and ductile iron materials. Through further refinement it was discovered that fast, efficient cutting and grinding of a multitude of other materials is possible. That includes mild steel, brick, granite, marble and other natural stones, ceramic materials, solid-surface materials, fiber reinforced plastics and a variety of masonry materials.</p>
<b>TSD Depressed Center Cup Wheel</b>
<p>FAST GRINDING of cast iron, ductile iron, steel, granite, marble and other natural stones, ceramic materials, solid-surface materials, fiber reinforced plastics, brick and a variety of masonry products.</p>
<p>Until now, standard diamond grinding wheels were the only choice for stone workers. They were expensive and wore quickly when used heavily.</p>
<p>The TSD (TENRYU Super Diamond) removes material very rapidly and will last longer than conventional diamond tooling.</p>
<p>Curved outer edge makes it easier to grind the insides of holes and curved shaped surfaces.</p>

Specially formulated C-6 carbide grade, combined with our unique tip design, resists breakage on impact and lasts longer- much longer than standard carbides or abrasive discs. Special tooth geometry with &quot;inserted&quot; tooth design greatly improves security of the tip, efficiency and durability.
Abrasive discs throw sparks and lots of dust including unhealthful fiberglass. You shouldn't be breathing it in! Steel-Pro® blades reduce spark production and eliminate abrasive wheel dust.
Abrasive discs wear quickly, requiring frequent blade changes. Steel-Pro® blades allow you to keep working; eliminating down time for frequent blade changes. In addition, Steel-Pro® cuts 5 to 10 times faster than abrasives. Typically, one Steel-Pro® blade will outlast somewhere between 15 to 30 abrasive blades. Think of all that non-productive &quot;down time&quot;.
Abrasive discs leave a sharp burr at the cutting edge that must be removed later. Steel-Pro® blades cut clean; eliminating this extremely time-consuming after-cut process. &quot;Time is money&quot;. Steel-Pro® saves BOTH!","TENRYU's complete series of steel cutting saw blades called &quot;Steel-Pro®&quot; makes light work out of all kinds of mild steel: steel studs, steel sheet, steel pipe, channel, threaded rod and much, much more.
