For convenience, a PF key can be used to switch between zones. ","","NX-240VP/340UP series radios employ NXDN®, an FDMA digital air interface with AMBE+2TM voice coding technology, unique filtering and a 4-level FSK modulation technique with low bit error rate (BER) even at weak RF signal strengths. As RF signal strength weakens with distance, analog reception becomes increasingly noisy and intermittent. NXDN®’s low BER improves reception in fringe areas, thereby “effectively” increasing coverage as much as 20% over analog.

Users can program a ProTalk® to any of the pre-stored frequencies, QT/DQT analog codes, RAN digital codes, thus assuring compatibility with other brands. The ProTalk® digital VHF NX-240V16P/P2 16-channel model
has 27 pre-stored frequencies while the ProTalk® digital UHF NX-340U16P/P2 16-channel model has 99. Both models have 39 QT tones and 168 DQT codes in analog mode and 64 RAN codes in digital mode.
