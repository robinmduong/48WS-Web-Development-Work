<b>Ultra-Violet Retardant</b>
PearlWeave Personnel Safety Net Systems and Debris Netting are provided with a latex coating. This treatment retards the effects of ultra-violet (UV) exposure and improves the nets' resistance to abrasion.<br></br>
<b>Fire Retardant</b>
PearlWeave's exclusive latex flame retardant treatment is unique in that it can be added to our standard Personnel Safety Net and Debris Netting coating. As a result, only our nets can pass NFPA 701 without a decrease in overall net performance.","","Pearlweave Safety Netting 48&quot; x 150&quot; Safety Netting Premium Orange","48&quot; x 150&quot; Premium Orange",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
