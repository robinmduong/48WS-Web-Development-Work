Radical new design. Enhanced for increased 
carbide embodiment. Reduced body to drilling 
diameter decreases hole wall friction. Unique 
new carbide composition and tip shape. Sturdy 
high grade chrome molybdenum steel body. This 
new core bit design will maximize drilling speed 
and tool life up to 30% over other sytems. 
The alternating pointed chisel carbide teeth 
and the spade carbide teeth are designed to 
optimize and enhance each other during the 
drilling operation. The chisel tips score and 
break up the materials as well as stabilize the 
core bits’ working characteristics. The spade 
tips further break and remove the materials. 
Even allows for drilling reinforced concrete. Use 
RebarCUTTER™ for smaller diameters. See
