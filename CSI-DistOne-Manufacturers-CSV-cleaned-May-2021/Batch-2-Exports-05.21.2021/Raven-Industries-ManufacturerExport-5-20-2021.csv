The outer black layer contains carbon black and the white side contains U.V. stabilizers for good outdoor longevity. The second film is produced by cross laminating two sheets of high density polyethylene, creating additional strength for optimum puncture and tear resistance. This unique process aligns the molecular structure of the high density polyethylene, which intensifies the sheet’s resilience lengthwise. By laminating these two layers of stretched film across the bias, the sheet has equal strength in all directions.
