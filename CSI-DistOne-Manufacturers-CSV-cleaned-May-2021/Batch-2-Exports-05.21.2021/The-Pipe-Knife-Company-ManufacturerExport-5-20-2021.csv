<br>Look for PAT NO 300600 or PIPEKNIFE® on your tool to verify authenticity!!","The PipeKnife® sealant cutout tools were invented by autoglass technicians to cut the urethane used to seal the windshield to the frame of the car. The design was specifically created to reach between the dash and windshield and provide extra reach and power to make the cut. The long-handled utility knife design also has room for extra blade storage in the barrel end of the knife.

The PipeKnife® was the original cutout tool, or long knife, commercialized for the AGR industry. It was invented and patented in 1987 and has proven to be the most popular sealant cutout tool in the autoglass replacement industry. The Original PipeKnife® is 14” in length and the 18” long PipeKnife®-XL is the most recent addition to the popular PipeKnife product line. Both PipeKnife® tools use standard 2-notch utility blades or will also hold the special serrated PipeKnife® blade (listed in accessories) or other long-length utility blades.

The PipeKnife® sealant cutout tools are also used extensively by caulking, waterproofing and concrete contractors to cut and remove sealant and caulk during flat glass window installs, concrete tilt-up joint and crack maintenance, and during building restoration work.","","Pipeknife Utility Cutter","Pipeknife Utility Cutter",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,

A second layer of protection is added by attaching an injected molded piece of plastic on the neck of blade. According to the company, the double layer of protection significantly reduces accidental scratching when the AGR technician inserts the blade into the urethane to remove the windshield.

The Scratch-Resistor blades were invented by an autoglass technician to address the installs on trucks and cars that increasingly were with reverse or no moulding designs, requiring extreme care to not scratch the paint during the urethane-cutting step.

The Scratch-Resistor blade now provides the technician with another weapon to efficiently and safely cut the urethane without scratching the paint.

The Scratch-Resistor is available in ¾, 1 and 1½ inch lengths. It can be ordered with only the powder coated protection layer or with the plastic neck cap. It is compatible with all standard cold knifes including the Power Advance and Easy Pro cold knife.","","","","Scratch-Resistor Blades",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
