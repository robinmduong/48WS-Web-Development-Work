This gives cabinet manufacturers the ability to offer over 10 different styles of raised panels for cabinet doors at a fraction of the cost of fixed knife cutters. Plus, these cutters have a specially designed raised panel knife that will leave cross grain cuts as smooth and splinter-free as cuts with the grain. The head is manufactured out of a high grade aircraft aluminum, so weight is kept to a minimum while strength is maintained. The Anti-Kickback Design of the head reduces the likelihood of kickbacks.

This unique geometric design has multiple cutting edges that produce greater shearing action, allowing for faster rotational speeds and more efficient cutting. Competitive Forstner Bit designs produce small chips and dust that collect in the cutting area, increasing friction and heat, thus causing the bit to dull quickly. Those designs also create holes with rough edges that require sanding.
