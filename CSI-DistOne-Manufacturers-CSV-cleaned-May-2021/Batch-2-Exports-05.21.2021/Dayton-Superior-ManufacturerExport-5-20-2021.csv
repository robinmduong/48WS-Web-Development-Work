Rapid-Setting, Heavy-Duty, Flowable Repair Mortar.<br><br>
<b><u>Purpose</u></b><br><br>
HD-50 is a fast setting, fiber reinforced, latex modified, heavy duty concrete repair mortar designed for areas where a rapid strength gain is required to minimize downtime. HD-50 is a cement based compound having similar characteristics to normal portland cement mixes and is bondable and compatible with portland cement concrete. It does not contain chlorides or magnesium phosphates. HD-50 is a one component product requiring only water to mix and apply, simplifying restoration of concrete surfaces. Areas repaired with HD-50 can be opened to traffic within one hour because the compressive strength of the patch is already in excess of 2,000 psi.","","Dayton Superior HD-50 Concrete Repair","Concrete Repair",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,

skid resistance for concrete surfaces.

Emery Non-Slip is applied to fresh concrete surfaces
to provide hard non-skid surfaces. It is ideal for the
floors of food processing plants, dairies, breweries,
industrial buildings, warehouses, shopping centers or

for decks, stairways, ramps or anywhere surfaces are
exposed to water.

The eye nut is cast with coil threads and is intended to be used with B12 Coil Rod that has been cut to the proper length. The use of the eye nut will eliminate the need to inventory several different lengths of eye bolts. To make permanent length eye bolts, it is possible to weld lengths of coil rod to the casting. Since improper welding techniques can result in reduced safe working loads, Dayton Superior recommends that you contact your local welding supply house for proper welding instructions and techniques. The F49 Eye Bolt is an F48 Eye Nut supplied with a specified length of coil rod that has been welded in place. In order to develop the F49 eye bolt's rated load, the shoulder must be tightened securely against the face of the concrete. The F48 Eye Nut and F49 Eye Bolt are intended for straight tensile loading only; pulling or lifting at an angle drastically reduces the safe working load and is not recommended. The F49A Eye Bolt is a forged, carbon steel, one-piece, shoulder pattern eye bolt. It is available with 3/4&quot; or 1&quot; diameter coil threads and is stocked in 3-1/2&quot; and 6&quot; lengths. Longer lengths are available on special order.In order to develop the F49A Eye Bolt's rated load, the shoulder must be tightened firmly against the face of the concrete. The eye bolt is intended for straight tensile loading only; pulling or lifting at an angle drastically reduces the safe working load and is not recommended. The F49A Eye Bolt meets material requirements of ASTM Standard A-489.","","Size: 3/4&quot;","Coil Lifting Eye Nut",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
