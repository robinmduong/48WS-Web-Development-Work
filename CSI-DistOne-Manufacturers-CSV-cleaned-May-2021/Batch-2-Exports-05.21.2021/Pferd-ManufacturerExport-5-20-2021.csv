For highly abrasive grinding with ultimate stock removal and very good tool life on large surfaces. The special grinding disc version combined with the matching backing pad allows maximum machining capacity in a very short time.
The backing pad and grinding disc are equipped with a patented quick-change system. This guarantees fast, tool-free disc change-ups.<br><br>
<b>Advantages:</b> Quick-change system, high-performance grinding agents and optimum cooling system result in:<br><br>
<li>Workpiece temperature reduced by up to 30 %.</li>
<li>Aggressiveness increased by up to 40 %.</li>
<li>Tool life increased by up to 30 %.</li>
<li>Low-vibration work.</li>
<li>Low noise emissions.</li>
<li>Low stress on the angle grinder.</li>
<li>Profitability increased by 35 %: Thanks to the combination of significantly increased abrasiveness during the grinding process and the longer tool life, CC-GRIND improves profitability by around 35 % compared with a conventional reinforced grinding disc.</li>
<li>Noise and Vibration reduced by 50 % compared with conventional reinforced grinding wheels.</li><br><br>

For highly abrasive grinding with ultimate stock removal and very good tool life on large surfaces. The special grinding disc version combined with the matching backing pad allows maximum machining capacity in a very short time.
The backing pad and grinding disc are equipped with a patented quick-change system. This guarantees fast, tool-free disc change-ups.<br><br>
<b>Advantages:</b> Quick-change system, high-performance grinding agents and optimum cooling system result in:<br><br>
<li>Workpiece temperature reduced by up to 30 %.</li>
<li>Aggressiveness increased by up to 40 %.</li>
<li>Tool life increased by up to 30 %.</li>
<li>Low-vibration work.</li>
<li>Low noise emissions.</li>
<li>Low stress on the angle grinder.</li>
<li>Profitability increased by 35 %: Thanks to the combination of significantly increased abrasiveness during the grinding process and the longer tool life, CC-GRIND improves profitability by around 35 % compared with a conventional reinforced grinding disc.</li>
<li>Noise and Vibration reduced by 50 % compared with conventional reinforced grinding wheels.</li><br><br>

For highly abrasive grinding with ultimate stock removal and very good tool life on large surfaces. The special grinding disc version combined with the matching backing pad allows maximum machining capacity in a very short time.
The backing pad and grinding disc are equipped with a patented quick-change system. This guarantees fast, tool-free disc change-ups.
<br>
<br>
Advantages: Quick-change system, high-performance grinding agents and optimum cooling system result in:
<li>Workpiece temperature reduced by up to 30 %.</li>
<li>Aggressiveness increased by up to 40 %.</li>
<li>Tool life increased by up to 30 %.</li>
<li>Low-vibration work.</li>
<li>Low noise emissions.</li>
<li>Profitability increased by 35 %: Thanks to the combination of significantly increased abrasiveness during the grinding process and the longer tool life, CC-GRIND improves profitability by around 35 % compared with a conventional reinforced grinding disc.</li>
<li>Low stress on the angle grinder.</li>
