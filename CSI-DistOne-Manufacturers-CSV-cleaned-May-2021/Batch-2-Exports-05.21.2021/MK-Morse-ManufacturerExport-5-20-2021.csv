Metal Devil® metal cutting circular saw blades are designed with different configurations for steel, stainless, aluminum, thin steel, and even steel studs. Important differences between blade configuration allow for specialty applications - number of teeth on the blade, carbide grade and the shape of the teeth. (1) per card
<br>
<br>
<li>Very little friction created while cutting due to the unique metallurgy of the blades, transfering heat away from the work-piece so it can be immediately handled</li>
<li>Hardly any vibration. Feels like cutting through wood rather than steel</li>
<li>Blades range from 5-3/8&quot; to 14&quot; (137-356mm) in diameter</li>
<li>Blades reach their full potential when used on special metal cutting circular saws</li>
<li>Designed to cut angle iron, c-channel, steel plate, thin steel, trusses, rebar, joists, conduit, grading, and aluminum</li>
