","This small but mighty M1 flashlight is the one model in the M series that calls for CR123 batteries. Not only do CR123 batteries have an extremely long shelf-life (10+ years) and maintain high voltage for plenty of power, they also work well in extremely cold temperatures where standard batteries can drain quickly. The M1 is a lightweight and powerful flashlight with the means to take on the elements when necessary.","","LENGTH: 3.82 in | 9.7 cm BATTERY TYPE: 1 x CR123 (3v) RECHARGEABLE: no","M1 LED LIGHT W/ AFS 150 LUMENS",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,

No messy wires, or separate battery removal and replacing. This light also features locking Advanced Focus System™ technology for a seamless projection of light up close or far away with just a push on the base of the bezel.

This all-new multi-tool allows you to grab a toolbox full of functionality and keep it at your fingertips, no matter where you might be: under the hood, at the campground, finishing honey-do projects around the house or cracking open a cold one at the tailgate.  The Rev features 14 soon-to-be-indispensable tools, an outside accessible 420HC blade and a replaceable pocket clip for easy carry, and as always is backed by the Leatherman 25-year warranty.</p>
<ol>																			
<li>																																		Locking Blade												<p>A knife blade that locks into place when fully deployed. A user must manually unlock the blade to fold it away, which allows for a much safer user experience.</p>																					</li>																			
<li>																																		Replaceable Pocket Clip												<p>A removable clip which allows the user to wear their multi-tool attached to a pocket or belt loop without the use of a sheath. By removing the clip, the user is able to easily carry their tool in a sheath if preferred.</p>																					</li>

Replaceable and indexible V-notch cutters can simply be flipped around for a fresh edge on-the-spot, or replaced completely when you're back home. Two wrenches—oxygen and Hex—are built right into the body of the tool; and, while other companies use stainless steel that takes much more force (if it even works at all) we use one-strike, Tungsten Carbide for our glass breaker tool. After all, if you're down to breaking glass, this is not the time to be beating your fist against the window.  The Z-Rex MOLLE sheath is included.</p>

Today, Leatherman has taken these two well-loved ideas and fused them into the first ever, 100% one-hand-operable multi-tool, the Leatherman OHT. This industry-first tool features spring-loaded pliers and wire-cutters so you don't tire your hand adjusting and readjusting your grip. Handles with visual imprints of the tool beneath make for quick identification. A lifesaving strap cutter and oxygen bottle wrench, threading for common-size cleaning rods and much more make this a one-handed workhorse of a tool.</p>

By locking them into place when fully open, the user can put pressure on the implement while safely completing the job, before manually unlocking the tool to stow it away.</p>																					</li>

The Leap also comes with a user-installed knife blade that can be added by a parent when the user is ready for more responsibility. Here at Leatherman, we celebrate the mentors who took the time to pass on a valuable skill or life lesson.
