<li>SIDEWINDER LEVER HANDLE This first-of-its-kind lever handle design will revolutionize the ratchet lever hoist industry. Its unique foldable handle and 360° rotating lever increases productivity while reducing the risk of operator injury.</li>
<li>CONVENIENT DIRECTIONAL INDICATOR Easy-to-use, highly visible directional indicator located on the handle clearly shows the operating direction as lifting, lowering or neutral.</li>
<li>EASY & SMOOTH FREE CHAINING For quick take up and positioning of slack chain - even with one hand. Designed not to accidently free chain while under load.
