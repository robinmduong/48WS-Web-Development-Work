These blades are stacked together with spacers between the blades. This offers incredibly efficient removal of any unwanted pavement.
Grinding can solve many irregularities in the pavement, including:
• Faulting at joints or cracks
• Roughness
• Wheel ruts in older concrete
• High noise levels
• Warping caused by moisture
Our grinding blades are available with ZENESIS™ Technology 2.0, the world's most advanced pattern technology, which ensures smooth consistent grinds and long blade life.
