Standard running 2 stage belt driven compressors running at lower speed. 

Lower speed stands for more user comfort and more durability. The noise levels are lower than on the equivalent standard speed units, and lower temperatures are created. This reduces the wear and increases the reliability. Thanks to these characteristics, these compressors are extremely suitable for more frequent and heavy duty applications in medium and large workshops.","","","PRO Slow Speed","PRO Slow Speed",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
