It is equipped with two contra-rotating roller brushes and a handle that rotates up to 90 degrees on both sides and can be locked in position. In the normal position, the machine is swung to the right and left like a single-disc machine and achieves a high area performance. Locking the handle in the 90-degree position allows the operator to work in precise lanes, moving forward and backward as with a standard scrubber dryer for effective cleaning of large areas and precision cleaning close to walls and other fixed obstacles. Even heavily structured surfaces, such as studded rubber floors and non-slip tiles, present no problems. Its low-profile construction enables it to reach floor areas underneath radiators, cupboards and shelves. The smooth-running induction motor has a high power output of 1600 W. The motor bracket is made of solid aluminium and the base plate of stainless steel for durability. No tools are required for carbon brush replacement. Two sturdy rollers guarantee easy maneuverablity, and the fold-down handle enables the unit to be stored and transported easily.","This innovative single-disc-style machine with counter-rotating roller brushes is suitable for deep cleaning and maintenance cleaning on hard surfaces as well as stripping, shampooing and polishing.","<h3>Technical data</h3>

This enables the machine to operate in the most economical temperature range (140° F) and at the maximum water flow rate, reducing fuel consumption by 25% and optimizing burner operating cycles compared to full-load operation at 180° F. 
Karcher’s mid and super-class series features a service switch that offers a choice of five  settings to suit local water hardness. This allows optimum metered quantities of anti-scaler and corrosion inhibitor to be added to the water supply, and prevents the buildup of lime scale on the heater coil. Operating  data can be called up any time, allowing you to make continual adjustments.Time-proven burner techno­logy with new turbo fan
Kärcher burner technology not only translates to more economical 
 operation, but also makes our hot water pressure washers trendsetters in    environmental protection thanks to their low emissions and highly efficient   operation. Easy Press and Servo Control (optional accessory) The Easy Press trigger gun significantly reduces holding and operation effort, and the precise Servo Controller allows the user to adjust water flow rate and operating pressure directly from the trigger gun.","The perfect machines for car dealers, building trade, 
agriculture and municipal use: our super class machines set standards in terms of technology, performance, ease of use, economy, service life and environmental protection.","<h3>Technical data</h3>

For very sticky dirt, the squeegees can be lifted with a foot pedal. Chemicals have more time to react, for better overall cleaning. Hard to reach areas (e.g., under furniture) are no problem thanks to the very low brush head.","Whether in a restaurant, store, hotel or kitchen, the BR 30/4 C scrubs and dries all hard surfaces gently and effectively. Simple to operate as upright vacuum cleaner.","<h3>Technical data</h3>

With the powerful battery (36 V / 344 Ah), long work intervals are possible. Thanks to the short wheelbase and the low device width, the machine impresses with its maneuverability and optimized area coverage. Even confined spaces can be cleaned thoroughly. Thanks to FACT, the brush speed can be adjusted to one of 3 levels according to requirements - Power Clean, Whisper and Fine Clean. The user-friendly EASY Operation switch and the intuitive color-coding enable extremely easy operation. With the eco!efficiency mode, turbine power, water volume and roller speed are reduced. Water and energy are saved and the run time is increased by around 20%. (This is a configuration example. This machine is available in a range of different configurations.)","The B 250 R scrubber drier with dual side brushes, is the cleaning solution for hard surface cleaning of large facilities.","<h3>Technical data</h3>

With the powerful battery (36 V / 344 Ah), long work intervals are possible. Thanks to the short wheelbase and the low device width, the machine impresses with its maneuverability and optimized area coverage. Even confined spaces can be cleaned thoroughly. Thanks to FACT, the brush speed can be adjusted to one of 3 levels according to requirements - Power Clean, Whisper and Fine Clean. The user-friendly EASY Operation switch and the intuitive color-coding enable extremely easy operation. With the eco!efficiency mode, turbine power, water volume and roller speed are reduced. Water and energy are saved and the run time is increased by around 20%. (This is a configuration example. This machine is available in a range of different configurations.)","The B 250 R scrubber drier with dual side brushes, is the cleaning solution for hard surface cleaning of large facilities.","<h3>Technical data</h3>

At 90 mm tall, the unit is flat enough to reach beneath radiators and furniture with low ground clearance. It picks up loose dirt within just 2 mm of its edges. The telescopic broomstick has a push handle and can be adjusted to suit the operator’s height, while a universal joint enables it to move in all directions. When not in use, it locks into the vertical position. The electric broom can run for roughly 30 minutes on carpets and 45 minutes on hard floors before the powerful nickel cadmium battery requires recharging. Charging time can be reduced from 12 hours to 50 minutes using the optional fast charger. Batteries can be swapped to permit uninterrupted working. No tools are required to change batteries or remove the roller brush. Any fibers that get wound around the brush can be removed by running a knife along a specially designed groove to sever them.","This is the first battery-powered electric broom for commercial users. With its roller brush and dirt container, it functions as a broom and dustpan. Can be used on hard floors and carpets.","<h3>Technical data</h3>

At the push of a button on the control panel, the user can switch from fixed to floating main sweeper roller (and vice versa). It automatically switches to the low-wear, fixed position when the machine is switched off. This increases the durability of the roller brush and reduces the sweeping costs. All of the sweeping functions are controlled, the raising and lowering of the main sweeper roller and the two side brushes are controlled using a single dial. When leaving the driver's seat, which is fitted with a seat contact mat, or switching off the motor, the main sweeper roller and the side brushes are lifted automatically. The wheel motor's electro-magnetic brake ensures the machine's stability. The main roller brush may be replaced without tools. A coarse dirt flap is integrated in front of the roller and activated with a foot pedal. The effective round filter system with 97 ft² filter area and automatic filter cleaning function ensures dust-free operation. The hydraulic lift waste container with 40 gallon capacity.","The first choice of professional, with ergonomic use on large areas both indoors and outdoors: the robust, comfortable KM 120/150 R ride-on sweeper features a curcular steel frame and waste bin container lift.","<h3>Technical data</h3>

The body of the ECO! T11 CartVac   is backed by a 10-year warranty   for years of use. The front shelf may be used for other cleaning equipment other   than the trash can, providing versatility to tackle a variety of   cleaning tasks. 
Easy to operate
Large, well placed handles make maneuvering the Kärcher ECO! T11 Bp Liner CartVac easy. Simple one-touch power switch. Coiled, retractable power cord is  easy to manage and discretely stored.
Quiet operation
Despite the strong vacuum motor, the 58 dBA noise level is ideal for   daytime cleaning. Operating noise level is measured at ear level, using the wand / floor tool. While the sound level at the machine body is actually only 53 dBA. These measurements are done per ISO test standards. The large 12&quot; rear wheels allow for easier maneuverability and less noise especially when    transported over thresholds and flooring imperfections. 
Configured for productivity
Convenience of 4:1 flex hose with aluminum telescoping wand for increased range of motion and   productivity. The Home Base supply pouch and   mop/broom clips keep everything you need discretely within reach. The industry-leading 100-minute continuous battery run time and 10-quart vacuum bag capacity allows for extended cleaning time.","Daytime cleaning redesigned. The Kärcher ECO!

The body of the ECO! T11 CartVac   is backed by a 10-year warranty   for years of use. The front shelf may be used for other cleaning equipment other   than the trash can, providing versatility to tackle a variety of   cleaning tasks. 
Easy to operate
Large, well placed handles make maneuvering the Kärcher ECO! T11 Bp Liner CartVac easy. Simple one-touch power switch. Coiled, retractable power cord is  easy to manage and discretely stored.
Quiet operation
Despite the strong vacuum motor, the 58 dBA noise level is ideal for   daytime cleaning. Operating noise level is measured at ear level, using the wand / floor tool. While the sound level at the machine body is actually only 53 dBA. These measurements are done per ISO test standards. The large 12&quot; rear wheels allow for easier maneuverability and less noise especially when    transported over thresholds and flooring imperfections. 
Configured for productivity
Convenience of 4:1 flex hose with aluminum telescoping wand for increased range of motion and   productivity. The Home Base supply pouch and   mop/broom clips keep everything you need discretely within reach. The industry-leading 100-minute continuous battery run time and 10-quart vacuum bag capacity allows for extended cleaning time.","Daytime cleaning redesigned. The Kärcher ECO!

This benefit pays for itself through longer operating periods between filter bag changes. Motor performance, air flow and the 6-stage filter system (with optional microfilter) have been designed to prevent loss of suction power. Its low center of gravity provides stability. The power cable can be stored in the cable storage or on a pull-out cable hook for convenience when changing rooms frequently. The suction hose on the unit has a simple but effective plug-in clip system that ensures  the suction hose does not become detached when the unit is pulled along behind the user. The new clip system allows an easy extension of the suction hose for cleaning steps and stairways. A power brush converts the unit to a brush-type vacuum cleaner. In cases where hygienic standards are stringent, a HEPA filter can be used with the paper filter bag.","The Kärcher T 12/1 is an efficient and quiet vacuum cleaner perfect for contract cleaners, hotels, restaurants, offices, shops, hospitals and private households.","<h3>Technical data</h3>
