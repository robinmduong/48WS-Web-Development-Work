<b>Limitations: </b>GREENchoice Projects & Repair is not designed for continuous submersion. When applying over paint, wallpaper, ceramic tile or other thin non-porous materials, sanding or scraping to penetrate that surface will allow drying and increase bond strength. This product cannot be used to bond one non-porous surface to another because such a situation will prevent drying. GREENchoice Projects & Repair works well on most metals, however, for heavy metal or steel applications, we recommend GREENchoice Premium Polyurethane. For best results, store adhesive above 40°F.","","29 oz. Cartridge","GREENchoice Projects & Repair Adhesive",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,

This product has no moisture limitations and calcium chloride or in-situ RH testing is not necessary. Once cured, the product is water-resistant and is not adversely affected by exposure to moisture or water. It provides a tough, flexible and tenacious bond to a variety of substrates. Being able to glue down and control moisture and sound in one application, it saves both labor and time. <br><br> Alternatively, Titebond 771-Step can be used just as a one-part adhesive simply by using a different sized trowel. Please see specific application guidelines in this document for details and instructions. It can also be combined with Titebond 531 or Titebond 531 PLUS Moisture Control Systems to achieve unlimited moisture protection. The elastomeric characteristics allow the adhesive to move with the wood as it expands and contracts over the life of the floor. It has unparalleled green grab and strength development, spreads easily, and cleans-up better than urethane products. Titebond 771-Step is most often used to secure solid wood, bamboo, cork, and engineered hardwood flooring. It can also be used to install plywood, ceramic tile, marble, cork underlayments, and stone inlays for residential and commercial applications. </p><ul><li>Unlimited moisture control protection</li><li>Formulated for wood flooring installation, moisture and sound control</li><li>One-coat application process to achieve full all-in-one performance</li><li>Extremely rapid cure rate</li><li>VOC-compliant with all federal and state regulations as well as the SCAQMD</li><li>Achieves IIC rating of 69 and STC rating of 67 for sound performance</li></ul>","37083077124","20 Oz.

This product has no moisture limitations and calcium chloride or in-situ RH testing is not necessary. Once cured, the product is water-resistant and is not adversely affected by exposure to moisture or water. It provides a tough, flexible and tenacious bond to a variety of substrates. Being able to glue down and control moisture and sound in one application, it saves both labor and time. <br><br> Alternatively, Titebond 771-Step can be used just as a one-part adhesive simply by using a different sized trowel. Please see specific application guidelines in this document for details and instructions. It can also be combined with Titebond 531 or Titebond 531 PLUS Moisture Control Systems to achieve unlimited moisture protection. The elastomeric characteristics allow the adhesive to move with the wood as it expands and contracts over the life of the floor. It has unparalleled green grab and strength development, spreads easily, and cleans-up better than urethane products. Titebond 771-Step is most often used to secure solid wood, bamboo, cork, and engineered hardwood flooring. It can also be used to install plywood, ceramic tile, marble, cork underlayments, and stone inlays for residential and commercial applications. </p><ul><li>Unlimited moisture control protection</li><li>Formulated for wood flooring installation, moisture and sound control</li><li>One-coat application process to achieve full all-in-one performance</li><li>Extremely rapid cure rate</li><li>VOC-compliant with all federal and state regulations as well as the SCAQMD</li><li>Achieves IIC rating of 69 and STC rating of 67 for sound performance</li></ul>","37083077193","3.5 Gallon Pail","Titebond 771-Step Adhesive, Moisture & Sound Control, 3.5 Gallon Pail",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
