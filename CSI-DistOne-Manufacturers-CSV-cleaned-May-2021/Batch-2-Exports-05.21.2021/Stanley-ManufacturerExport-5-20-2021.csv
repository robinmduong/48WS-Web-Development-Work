The deep cutting, corkscrew-like threads provide for smooth entry and a powerful hold. When removed, the Wall-dog leaves a much smaller than toggles or other systems. For aesthetic appearances, the Wall-Dog is available in two color finishes: white and chrome; and in two head styles: Pan and oval. For fastening into wallboard or wood, no pre-drilling is required--the anchor is inserted through the fixture and screwed in with an ordinary Philips screwdriver. Fastening into concrete, hollow or grout-filled concrete masonry, brick and plaster requires a pre-drilled hole using a 3/16&quot; ANSI bit. Wall Dog anchors are ideal for light to medium duty anchoring.","","","","1/4 X 1-1/4&quot; PAN HD WALL ANCHOR - CHROME - 100 PE",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
