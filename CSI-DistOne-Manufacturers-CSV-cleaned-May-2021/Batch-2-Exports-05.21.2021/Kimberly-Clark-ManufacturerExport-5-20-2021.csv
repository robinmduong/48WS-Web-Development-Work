Drying is one of the most important steps in the hand washing process, and how you dry matters. Forced air dryers and hot air dryers can take two or even three times as long to use as a paper towel, and studies show that, while the overall cost per use is comparable, the likelihood of spreading germs is greatly reduced with the use of absorbent, single-use drying towels, such as white Scott Essential (formerly Kleenex) Hard Roll Paper Towels. Germ counts are significantly lower following the use of a touch-free paper towel dispenser (like the compatible Kimberly-Clark Professional Hard Roll Paper Towel Dispenser)—as much as a 200% decrease when compared with using either jet or hot air dryers. And, rather than blowing germs into the air during use, the paper towels are thrown neatly away. These paper towel rolls offer terrific hand drying performance, so your guests will waste less.
