Advanced diamond technology provides extreme durability in metal cutting applications, leading to increased productivity, reduced downtime, and a lower cost per cut compared to thin bonded cut-off wheels. 

Diameter retention:because LENOX MetalMax is made with diamonds, it doesn't get smaller. The cutting depth stays the same throughout its life, meaning better control, reach and precision.

MetalMax delivers 1,000 or more cuts with no need for wheel changes. That is 30 times longer life than thin bonded cut-off wheels.* 

Long Life: 
Advanced diamond technology provides extreme durability in metal cutting applications, leading to increased productivity, reduced downtime, and a lower cost per cut compared to thin bonded cut-off wheels. 

Diameter retention:because LENOX MetalMax is made with diamonds, it doesn't get smaller. The cutting depth stays the same throughout its life, meaning better control, reach and precision.

The slot is wider than most and is placed lower on the hole saw with multiple leverage points to easily eject the plug . The hole saw is 10-Percent taller than traditional hole saws to deliver cleaner cuts through two-by lumber. The Speed Slot efficiently removes saw dust and chips while producing a fast cut and preventing the plug from getting stuck. The saw has a high heat tolerant coating that reduces gumming and has no paint in the inside to make plug removal easier.
