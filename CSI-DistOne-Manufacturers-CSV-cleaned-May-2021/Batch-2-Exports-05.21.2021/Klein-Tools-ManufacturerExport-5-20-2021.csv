The nut drivers have magnetic tips to help retain the nut while driving, and wrench assist for additional torque. The heavy-duty shaft has a classic Cushion-Grip handle, and each nut driver end is color coded for easy identification.

“These nut drivers are designed for flexibility, with the hollow-through shaft,” said senior product manager Raul Rosales. “Each nut driver is formed from a single piece of cold-formed steel resulting in a solid piece of metal that can withstand a great amount of torque.”

Heavy-Duty Nut Drivers are available in six individual sizes (1/4”, 5/16”, 3/8”, 7/16” 1/2” and 9/16”), and 4-piece and 6-piece nut driver sets.","","","","Klein Tools Heavy-Duty Nut Drivers",,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,,,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,,0,simple,,
