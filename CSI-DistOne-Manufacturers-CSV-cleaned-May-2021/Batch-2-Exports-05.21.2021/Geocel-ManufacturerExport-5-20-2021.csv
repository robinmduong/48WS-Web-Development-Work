<li>GeoBond Double Bonding Tape is a double bonding tape that will adhere similar or dissimilar substrates together to form a water tight seal. Its flexible sealing characteristics will adjust with the movement activity of the structure. GeoBond Double Bonding Tape has advanced S-Polymer technology that prevents plasticizer migration often associated with other tapes when they have prolonged contact with TPO, PVC, EPDM, asphalt, and other common roofing substrates. It is used for lap seam repairs, flashings, and where various substrates are to be adhered to each other. Holes and cracks can be repaired by forming a cord and placing into the void. It applies and adheres to wet surfaces below 0° F, and maintains its thermal stability up to 300° F. GeoBond Double Bonding Tape will not crack, harden, or oxidize over time, and it remains flexible to accommodate the natural movements of the roof.</li>
