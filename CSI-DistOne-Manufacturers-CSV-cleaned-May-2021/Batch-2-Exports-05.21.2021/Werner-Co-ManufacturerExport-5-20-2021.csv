","<p> The D7100-2LV series extension ladders boast a duty rating of 375 pounds and have factory-installed LeveLok levelers to enable the ladders to adapt to uneven terrain. With simple foot action, each leveler can extend up to 10&quot; in 3/16&quot; increments. These ladders are ideal for utility or telecommunication industries. The external guides at the top of the base section secure the interlocking rails. The top of the fly section has pre-pierced holes for easy installation of accessories. The base and fly sections easily separate to use the base section as a single ladder. Fiberglass rails are non-conductive for working near electricity. (36' & 40' do not have interlocking rails).</p><br>

","<p> The 7800 combination step and extension ladders are versatile and easy to transport yet carry a duty rating of 375 pounds. As an extension ladder, the top rung is a padded V-rung for use against a tree or a pole. The protective rubber covered end caps are mar-resistant. Nylon-coated rung wear sleeves and guides increase the ease of raising and lowering the extension. Fixed aluminum locks with bearing plates distribute the load onto the rung where it should be. The TRACTION-TRED round rungs are slip resistant. In the stepladder position, this ladder can be used by one or two people. The 375 pound duty rating applies to each side of the ladder making it ideal for the worksite.
