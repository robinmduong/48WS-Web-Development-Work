<li>Diablo made Dura-Carbide™ features up to 2X more carbide that withstands up to 1800°F of intense heat to combat rebar hits versus standard bits that fail at 800°F</li>
<li>Impact Resistant 4-Cutter Full Carbide heat extracts smaller bites of rebar for controlled, consistent carbide wear and reduced vibration to deliver fast, precise holes</li>
<li>Tri-Metal Fusion Welding features up to 3X stronger weld to keep the full carbide head intact during extreme impact such as rebar</li>

The Rebar Demon bits feature up to 2X more Dura-Carbide to withstand up to 1800°F of intense heat whereas standard bits fail at 800°F. Diablo’s impact resistant 4-cutter full-carbide head withstands the stress of high-powered hammer drills and the impact of rebar by taking small bites of rebar to deliver controlled carbide wear, reduced vibration and up to 7X longer life. Produced with Tri-Metal Fusion Welding, the full-carbide head resists heat and prevents breakage in extreme impact situations. Precision Tip delivers the stability and accuracy required to produce fast, precise holes in reinforced concrete for anchor setting.
