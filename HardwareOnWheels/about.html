    <p>Hardware on Wheels started business in 2000 with the idea that we could do better than the other guy. Better in
    service; better in pricing; and better product quality. Our motto is to build long-term relationships to help a company
    save time and money in acquiring needed supplies and hardware.</p>
    <p>After 11 years, a permanent location for Hardware on Wheels was established in downtown Manchester, CT. We offer both wholesale and retail sales of US and Metric fasteners in gr5, gr8, and stainless steel as well as non-specific vehicle parts. This includes rivets, wheel hardware, brass fittings and hose, electrical terminals and cables,and plastic retaining clips.</p>
    <p>We also carry a full line of consumable products for all your maintenance needs including abrasives, aerosol lubricants and cleaners, safety gear, drills, knife and saw blades, janitorial paper goods and cleaning supplies, and packaging materials.</p>
